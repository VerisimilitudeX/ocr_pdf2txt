graming in myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic
fatigue syndrome: A narrative of latent viruses. J
Intern Med. 2024;296:93-115.

Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syn-
drome (ME/CFS) is a chronic disease present-
ing with severe fatigue, post-exertional malaise,
and cognitive disturbances—among a spectrum
of symptoms—that collectively render the patient
housebound or bedbound. Epigenetic studies in
ME/CFS collectively confirm alterations and/or
malfunctions in cellular and organismal physiol-
ogy associated with immune responses, cellular
metabolism, cell death and proliferation, and neu-
ronal and endothelial cell function. The sudden
onset of ME/CFS follows a major stress factor that,
in approximately 70% of cases, involves viral infec-
tion, and ME/CFS symptoms overlap with those of
long COVID. Viruses primarily linked to ME/CFS
pathology are the symbiotic herpesviruses, which
follow a bivalent latent-lytic lifecycle. The complex

interaction between viruses and hosts involves
strategies from both sides: immune evasion and
persistence by the viruses, and immune activation
and viral clearance by the host. This dynamic inter-
action is imperative for herpesviruses that facilitate
their persistence through epigenetic regulation of
their own and the host genome. In the current
article, we provide an overview of the epigenetic
signatures demonstrated in ME/CFS and focus
on the potential strategies that latent viruses—
particularly Epstein-Barr virus—may employ in
ong-term epigenetic reprograming in ME/CFS.
Epigenetic studies could aid in elucidating rel-
evant biological pathways impacted in ME/CFS
and reflect the physiological variations among the
patients that stem from environmental triggers,
including exogenous viruses and/or altered viral
activity.

Introduction

Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syn-
drome (ME/CFS) is a heterogeneous chronic dis-
ease of unknown etiology that presents with over-
whelming fatigue that is not alleviated by rest.
Common symptoms include fever, lymphadenopa-
thy, myalgia, headache, cognitive impairment,
orthostatic intolerance, and sleep disturbances.
ME/CFS symptoms may exacerbate after physi-
cal or mental activity, a condition known as post-
exertional malaise (PEM) [1, 2]. Current estimates
suggest that as many as 0.89% of adults may
suffer from ME/CFS, and approximately 70% of
patients report that an infectious-like illness pre-

ceded the disease onset [3-6]. The recent pandemic
has highlighted the chronic sequelae of viral infec-
tions in certain individuals, notably in long COVID
patients. Long COVID pathology significantly over-
laps with ME/CFS, and a substantial proportion
of those patients meet the ME/CFS diagnostic
criteria [7-9]. Regarding the underlying pathol-
ogy in ME/CFS, numerous studies have identi-
fied abnormalities in the immune system [10-19],
central nervous system and autonomic nervous
system (ANS) deficits [20-31], cellular metabolism
and mitochondrial dysfunction [32-43], as well as
defects in the cardiopulmonary and vascular sys-
tems [44-50].

Multiple viral infections have long been implicated
in the onset and chronicity of ME/CFS pathol-
ogy, but no single pathogen has been identified.
Viruses predominantly linked to ME/CFS belong
to the family of herpesviruses that include large
double-stranded DNA viruses, notably Epstein—
Barr virus (EBV) [51-57], human herpesvirus-6
(HHV-6) [58-60], HHV-7 [58, 59], herpes sim-
plex virus-1 (HSV-1), and HSV-2 [3, 7, 61]. Her-
pesviruses are common infectious agents within
the general population that establish life-long
latency in humans. Sporadic reactivation of her-
pesviruses facilitates transmission to uninfected
individuals, hence ensuring their survival over time
[62]. It may occur spontaneously, albeit most com-
monly following a stressful event, such as an infec-
tion, septic shock, trauma, or emotional or men-
tal stress, and it is related to immune suppression
and loss of T-cell surveillance [5]. EBV infection is
a risk factor in a subgroup of ME/CFS patients
[56], and a higher rate of active EBV infection has
been demonstrated in a subgroup of patients as
well [51]. Multiple studies support the hypothe-
sis of altered EBV activity in ME/CFS [54, 63-69].
However, the association between EBV infection
and ME/CFS is not established yet.

The persistence of ME/CFS symptoms after the
triggering infection has ceased implies that effec-
tor mechanisms are continuously present, whereas
the initial trigger in ME/CFS, and similarly in long
COVID, is a transient event.

Epigenetic reprograming in ME/CFS

First clues for a genetic component in ME/CFS
emerged from the observation that mothers and
children diagnosed with ME/CFS share similar
symptoms, in contrast to fathers and their chil-
dren, suggesting that ME/CFS results from a com-
bined effect of sex-biased genetic predisposition
and environmental factors [70]. A single-gene vari-
ation is less probable to account for the complex
pathology of ME/CFS, and most studies suggest
a varied genetic contribution based on the associ-
ation between a small number of polymorphisms.
The most significant gene alterations in ME/CFS
have been summarized by Deumer et al. [71] and
indicate pathways related to immunity, inflamma-
tion, neurotransmission, oxidative stress, the cat-
echolamine pathway, the serotoninergic system,
and circadian rhythm. A systematic review by Tzi-
astoudi et al. [72] on gene alterations—common in
ME/CFS and long COVID—highlighted the involve-

ment of genes related to inflammation (mediated
by chemokine- and cytokine-signaling pathways),
T-cell activation, and Toll-like receptor—signaling
pathways.

Epigenetic mechanisms play a crucial role in bridg-
ing external environmental signals with internal
cellular responses, and their reversible nature
makes them particularly relevant when consider-
ing the onset of complex acquired diseases such as
ME/CFS. ME/CFS has been associated with epige-
netic alterations, including changes in DNA methy-
lation (DNAm) profiles (Table 1), modifications in
chromatin acetylation, and the differential expres-
sion of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) (Table 2). The
multitude of systemic alterations and molecular
pathways previously implicated in ME/CFS pathol-
ogy align with the discoveries from epigenetic stud-
ies, as outlined in Fig. 1. The suggested down-
stream effects of epigenetic alterations are briefly
summarized in Fig. 2.

DNA methylation studies in ME/CFS

Fourteen studies have examined alterations in
DNAm profile in patients with ME/CFS and are
summarized in Table 1. Among them, eight stud-
ies opted for a genome-wide perspective on DNAm,
whereas six studies focused on the methylation
status of individual genes.

Most studies on DNAm patterns suggest alter-
ations in immune responses [73-80]. The primary
sample investigated was peripheral blood mononu-
clear cells (PBMCs), with a few studies focusing
on isolated subpopulations such as CD4* (clus-
ter of differentiation 4 positive) [80] and CD3*
cluster of differentiation 3 positive T cells) [79].
n the latter, a significant association of DNAm
patterns with single-nucleotide polymorphisms in
neighboring genes was demonstrated [79]. Corre-
lations of DNAm patterns with symptom sever-
ity (and particularly PEM) have been documented
76], with changes in the patients’ health status
observed longitudinally, including a relapse and
a recovery cycle [77]. A comparison of two geo-
graphically distinct cohorts yielded similar out-
comes [75]. Depending on sample type, the com-
parison of DNAm patterns among studies showed
both overlapping and distinct signatures, hence
validating that methylation changes were specific
to the distinct physiological functions of different
cell types [73].

Fig. 1 Epigenetic studies in myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) reflect alterations or mal-
functions in previously documented aspects of ME/CFS pathology summarized in four main categories: (1) immunological
abnormalities that manifest as persistent immune activation and exhaustion, with deregulated production of cytokines and
compromised immune cell function [10-19]; (2) mitochondrial dysfunction and impaired cellular metabolism that features
impaired glucose metabolism, redox imbalance, and nitrosative stress [32-43]; (3) central and autonomic nervous system
abnormalities that encompass hypothalamic pituitary axis (HPA) deregulation, hypoperfusion-metabolic dysfunction, neu-
roinflammation and autoreactivity toward B-adrenergic (B-AdR) and muscarinic acetylcholine (M-AChR) receptors [20-31];
(4) cardiopulmonary and vascular abnormalities that include autonomic and endothelial dysfunction, hyper-coagulopathy
and platelet activation, oxidative stress, and low-grade inflammation [44-50]. Auto-abs, autoantibodies; CD3*, cluster of

CSF, cerebrospinal fluid; EVs, extracellular vesicles; IncRNA, long non-coding RNA; miRNA, micro-RNA; NK, natural killer
cells; PBMC, peripheral blood mononuclear cells; WB, whole blood.

Metabolic perturbations in ME/CFS are consistent
with a hypometabolic state [32]. They resemble
the evolutionarily conserved response to environ-
mental stress known as “dauer state” [36] and are
mirrored in DNAm patterns of PBMCs [73, 74, 76-
80]. Altered DNAm patterns related to metabolic
responses were correlated with symptom severity
[76], and they have also been identified in a uni-
form cohort of ME/CFS patients with an infectious
disease onset [74].

Central nervous system and ANS dysfunction in
ME/CFS are likewise reflected in DNAm pat-
terns [73, 77]. The hypothalamic—pituitary—adrenal
(HPA) axis is responsible for regulating the stress
response. Differences in glucocorticoid sensitiv-
ity in vitro—correlated with epigenetic patterns

related to HPA axis signaling—further support the
hypothesis of a dysfunctional HPA axis [78].

Six studies have explored the DNAm status of
single genes in ME/CFS patients. Brain-derived
neurotropic factor (BDNF) hypomethylation in
exon 9 accounted for the altered BDNF levels in
the serum [81]. CpG methylation pattern of seven
sites in the perforin (PRF1) gene was correlated
with PRF1 levels [82]. The glucocorticoid receptor
(GR) NR3C1 gene was explored in two studies and
found to be hypomethylated compared to controls
[83, 84]. Two studies investigated the association
of the methylation status with genetic variability
for serotonin receptor 2A (HTR2A) and catechol-
O-methyltransferase (COMT) genes. The promoter
of HTR2A presented with the polymorphism-

DNA methylation profiles and the expression of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). Epigenetic changes are illustrated along
with the proposed downstream effects and functional mechanisms: (A) immune system abnormalities, (B) CNS (central)

(D) cardiovascular abnormalities. DNA methylation studies are denoted in red and ncRNA studies are denotaed in blue.

1438G/A (rs6311) exhibited altered methylation
profiles, affecting the binding of GR and other
transcription factors [85]. DNAm in the S-COMT
promoter was associated with COMT haplotypes
and enzymatic activity in patients with ME/CFS
and fibromyalgia (FM), whereas increased DNAm in
the MB-COMT promoter was reported only among
the patient groups. COMT regulates nociceptive
processing and inflammation [86].

Histone modifications in ME/CFS

Increased histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity was
reported in PBMC samples, which correlated with
low cortisol levels [87], and levels of HDAC-2
and HDAC-3 were found to be upregulated in
ME/CFS [87]. Significant changes in proteins

involved in histone methylation at H3K4 (activat-
ing gene expression) and H3K27 (repressing gene
expression) were reported in ME/CFS [88]. Fol-
lowing an exercise test, responsive genes demon-
strated elevated levels of HDAC-1 and HDAC-2
binding sites and changes in 21 proteins with reg-
ulatory functions in acetylation and deacetylation
[89]. Patterns of serum metabolites in ME/CFS link
a state of hypermetabolism and hypoacetylation,
which was suggested to correlate with the develop-
ment of PEM [90].

Non-coding RNAs in ME/CFS

levels of ncRNAs in ME/CFS (Table 2). Most of
them focused on the investigation of circulating

micro-RNAs (miRNAs) because the latter could
potentially be used as noninvasive biomarkers for
disease diagnosis and prognosis.

Similarly to the DNAm studies, alterations in
the expression patterns of circulating miRNAs in
plasma, in PBMCs, or in isolated cytotoxic cell
subpopulations were related to immune functions
91-95]. Differences were observed both at base-
line and following post-exertional stress challenge
92, 93] and could discriminate ME/CFS from
FM patients, a frequent comorbidity with over-
lap in symptomatology [94]. An attempt to asso-
ciate changes in plasma miRNAs with a her-
pesvirus infection (HHV-6A/B) showed no associ-
ations with HHV-6A/B positivity [95]. Conversely,
miRNA expression patterns were associated with
sex and the nutritional status of the patients, high-
lighting the importance of subjects’ metabolic state
92].

Signatures of miRNA expression related to neu-
ronal and endocrine pathways come from a study
in which the miRNomes were analyzed simulta-
neously in PBMCs and extracellular vesicles [96].
The emerging pathways in PBMCs included post-
transcriptional silencing by small RNAs, circa-
dian clock, chromatin organization and modify-
ing enzymes, and several others related to the
X-chromosome encoded methyl-CpG-binding pro-
tein 2 (MECP2) gene. Pathways related to MECP2
were proposed to involve environmental sex-biased
effectors for ME/CFS, whereas those related to
neurotrophic receptor tyrosine kinase signaling
were associated with cognitive disability and sen-
sorial dysfunctions.

The induction of a set of miRNAs—which were pre-
viously reported to regulate endothelial function in
ME/CFS plasma samples—was found independent
of disease severity and was confirmed in PBMC
microarray data from public miRNA data reposi-
tories [97]. Furthermore, HDAC-1 represented the
most relevant node within the network.

Alterations in the pattern of ncRNAs in local bio-
logical fluids such as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
naturally point toward pathways related to the
function of the proximal organ/system. Alterations
in miRNA expression in CSF following exercise
were related to cleavage of amyloids, apoptosis,
and trans-endothelial migration [98]. Interestingly,
comparison with Gulf War Illness (GFI)—which
presents with substantial symptom overlap to

ME/CFS—demonstrated distinct miRNA patterns
that were suggested to account for different mech-
anisms for PEM in GFI and ME/CFS patients.

Long ncRNAs (IncRNAs) constitute nearly 68% of
the transcriptome and were suggested to have a
significant regulatory role in antiviral interferon
(IFN) response, viral transcription, and latency
[99]. Analysis of a selected panel of very long ncR-
NAs (>5 kb) in PBMCs could differentiate ME/CFS
from healthy donors and relate to altered responses
to oxidative stress, chronic viral infection, and
hypoxemia [100]. The expression profile of circR-
NAs in the peripheral blood of ME/CFS patients
following PEM induction is related to histone mod-
ification, cellular catabolic processes, protein mod-
ification processes, and cellular component organi-
zation [101].

EBV in ME/CFS pathology

EBV infects nearly 95% of adults worldwide. It is
primarily transmitted through the saliva, infect-
ing B cells and epithelial cells in the oral cav-
ity, and though in most cases the infection is
asymptomatic or mild, in young adults and ado-
escents it may lead to infectious mononucleosis
(IM) [102]. EBV infection is a key feature in a sub-
group of ME/CFS patients. IM may be a risk fac-
tor for ME/CFS in adolescents since, after 6, 12,
and 24 months of IM, 13%, 7%, and 4% of sub-
jects, respectively, met the disease diagnostic cri-
teria [103]. In adults, persisting illness and fatigue
have been correlated with evidence of EBV infec-
tion [104]. The mechanisms of immune escape
that develop in latently infected cells after primary
EBV infection [57] resemble features of immune
dysregulation described in ME/CFS (e.g., compro-
mised cytotoxic and T-cell responses, augmented
Th2 and T-regulatory responses) [5]. Incompe-
tent immunosurveillance could potentially result
in increased proliferation of EBV-latent cells. A
hypothetical scenario could be that the trigger
of EBV-associated ME/CFS could be the latently
infected cells rather than the viral load [57]. In
our study [54], SARS-CoV-2 infection resulted in
elevated antibodies against Epstein-Barr nuclear
antigen 1 (EBNA1) exclusively in ME/CFS patients,
contrary to anti-viral capsid antigen (VCA) antibod-
ies. EBNA1 is the only EBV-protein produced in all
EBV-latency stages, whereas VCA is produced dur-
ing recent infection/reactivation [105].

Epigenetic mechanisms in latent-lytic lifecycle and
reactivation of EBV

The initial site of herpesvirus infection usually
supports lytic replication, resulting in the fulmi-
nant production of infectious progeny. Establish-
ment of persistent infection at secondary anatomi-
cal sites or cell types (e.g., memory B cells) facil-
itates viral latency. The EBV genome can adopt
four latency types (types O and [-III) with associ-
ated transcriptional repertoires [106]. EBV DNA in
virions is “epigenetically naive,” but following infec-
tion, EBV maintains its genome in the host cell
as an extrachromosomal circular episome. Follow-
ing the chromatinization of the viral DNA by host
histones, it is subsequently subjected to epigenetic
modification. Latency is hence achieved when viral
genes required for lytic replication are epigeneti-
cally repressed, whereas genes required for latent
state are maintained in an active chromatin state
[107].

Epigenetic silencing of viral DNA may have origi-
nally evolved as an innate antiviral defense mech-
anism that EBV successfully subverted to avoid
detection by the host adaptive immune system
and persist life-long in the host [108]. Epigenetic
modifications occurring for the establishment of
herpesvirus latency and reactivation are briefly
described below and reviewed in detail in Refs.
[109-112]. During EBV infection, the expression of
DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMTS3B is dysregulated
and linked to latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1).
LMP1 has been shown to induce DNMT1. Modifica-
tion of the host genes evident by promoter hyper-
methylation included ELL3 (Elongation Factor RNA
Polymerase II-Like 3), RBMS5 (involved in RNA splic-
ing), the distal promoter of IRF5, SMAD4 (moth-
ers against decapentaplegic homolog 4, involved
in transforming growth factor beta signaling), and
retinoic acid receptor-f2 [108].

DNA, histone, and chromatin modifications

The methylation status of the EBV genome con-
trols the transition from latent to lytic state [113]
and requires the expression of two early immediate
genes, BZLF1 and BRLF1, which encode the tran-
scription factors Zta (also known as ZEBRA, EB1,
and Z) and Rta (also known as R) [114]. Z is the
only known transcription factor to preferentially
activate the methylated form of a target promoter
[115]. The activity of Z (Zp) and R (Rp) promoters
is primarily regulated by host transcription factors,
and although DNAm of the Rp inhibits its activa-

tion, it enhances the ability of Z to activate the
Rp [116]. Rp activation has been suggested as the
first step required for Z disruption of viral latency.
EBV induces DNAm in most lytic genes in B cells,
but the Zp region remains unmethylated to facili-
tate activation by specific host transcription factors
{117}.

EBV has evolved multiple ways to overcome epi-
genetic silencing by the host. One mechanism
involves packaging factors into the tegument of
viral particles that inhibit epigenetic repression by
the host cells. For example, the tegument pro-
tein BNRF1 localizes to promyelocytic leukemia
nuclear bodies (PML-NBs) and disassembles the
histone chaperone complex Daxx-ATRX by bind-
ing Daxx and displacing ATRX. The consequence is
the restriction of the PML-NBs complex to deposit
repressive forms of histones on the viral promoter
Wp [118]. EBV regulates patterns of repressive his-
tone modifications, leading to aberrant DNAm and
reprograming of host cells and their progeny. EBV
can induce the expression of DNMTs and/or poly-
comb group (PcG) proteins such as EZH2. The reg-
ulation of BZLF1 expression is a critical determi-
nant of whether EBV remains in a latent or reacti-
vated state. The Zp region—which controls BZLF1
expression—is primarily regulated by histone mod-
ifications, including suppressive markers, such as
H3K27me3, H3K9me2/3, and H4K20me3, during
latency. These repressive histone markers help
keep the promoter silent, whereas histone acety-
lation, phosphorylation, and H3K4me3 are associ-
ated with viral reactivation. Among these modifica-
tions, H3K27me3 appears to be crucial for main-
taining latency. These epigenetic markers strike
a balance, allowing for repression during latency
while permitting activation upon stimulation [118,
119].

EBV-derived ncRNAs

EBV infection triggers a cascade of events that
collectively induce the expression of both viral
and host ncRNAs [120]. EBV ncRNAs are grouped
into EBV-encoded small RNAs (EBERs) and right-
ward transcripts from the Bam HIA region (BARTs)
[121]. The patterns of expression of EBV-derived
ncRNAs have been associated with different EBV
latency types in various cancers, and they have
significantly contributed to understanding EBV-
induced carcinogenesis [109, 117]. The EBERs are
expressed during all the latency states and are
markers for latently infected cells [117]. The BART

transcripts give rise to 44 miRNAs, whereas 3 miR-
NAs originate from the vicinity of the BHRF1 ORF.
EBV-derived miRNAs expressed during latency
may both inhibit the expression of viral lytic genes
and regulate host gene expression [122]. EBV miR-
NAs are secreted in exosomes as well, thus extend-
ing the reach of their regulatory effects [123].

The primary targets of EBV-miRNAs are host
genes; they regulate multiple biological processes
(apoptosis, tumor suppression, and immune reg-
ulation) and cell-signaling pathways (NF«B, Wnt,
and MAP3K2), many of which are also naturally
controlled by host miRNAs. EBV-miRNAs facili-
tate viral persistence by inhibiting T-cell responses
and facilitate recognition escape by the host
immune system. Examples include direct tar-
geting of IL-6R (miR-BART6-3p), dampening of
EBV-triggered RIG-I-like receptor signaling and
type I IFN response, direct targeting of IFN-y
(miR-BART20-5p), and escape of NK-cell-mediated
killing [120, 124].

EBV-induced IncRNAs can modulate viral gene
transcription and host gene expression by modi-
fying histone marks at gene promoters. They may
affect cellular processes such as the IFN responses,
the unfolded protein response, and mitochondrial
antiviral signaling [99]. EBV can generate circR-
NAs, including spliced transcripts in the BART
region [125] and have been found in clinical sam-
ples from EBV-related cancers [126]. The function
of viral cireRNAs is unknown, though their sim-
ilar structure to the host circRNAs implies that
they have equivalent roles in restricting viral over-
proliferation as a means of immune escape [127].

Viral-induced perturbations in cellular metabolism and
epigenetics

Viral infections—including herpesviruses—have
profound effects on cellular metabolism and mito-
chondrial function. They may induce alterations
in mitochondrial morphology, a reduction in respi-
ration or mitochondrial membrane potential [128,
129]. Viral proteins and nucleic acids can disrupt
metabolic pathways, leading to altered energy pro-
duction, decreased ATP synthesis, increased reac-
tive oxygen species production, and a metabolic
shift toward glycolysis [130, 131]. EBV targets
the mitochondrial one-carbon metabolism that
drives nucleotide, mitochondrial NADPH, and glu-
tathione production [132]. Disturbances in cellu-
lar metabolism and mitochondrial dysfunction in

ME/CFS patients could potentially result from a
persistent/recurrent viral stimulus [133], which
could arise either from the reactivation of latent
viruses and/or insufficient management and elim-
ination by the immune system.

Alterations in cellular metabolism are dynamically
integrated into the regulation of epigenetic mech-
anisms and ensuing gene transcription. Epige-
netic modifications are mediated by enzymes (e.g.,
DNA methyltransferases or hydroxylases, histone
acetyltransferases or deacetylases), the activities of
which are regulated in part by the concentrations
of their required tricarboxylic acid cycle-derived
metabolic substrates or cofactors [134, 135].

A typical infection triggers immune activation that
is characterized by a metabolic shift toward gly-
colysis. This shift is essential for immune cells
to meet the energy demands for their prolifera-
tion and the availability of intermediate metabo-
lites that are necessary for effector protein func-
tion. Those metabolic shifts are transient; how-
ever, in severe or persistent/recurrent infections,
their prolongation may contribute to epigenetic
changes that eventually might cause immunosup-
pression. Immunosuppression may result either
from epigenetic silencing of cytokine genes or by
de-repression of immune inhibitory factors [136].
In this context, the observed transition toward gly-
colysis in individuals with ME/CFS has been sug-
gested to be associated with a combination of fac-
tors, including histone deacetylation, a sustained
decrease in acetate production through glycolysis,
and disturbances in the acetylation of cytoplasmic
and mitochondrial enzymes [90].

Histone lactylation is a recently described epige-
netic mechanism that involves metabolic interme-
diates produced during glycolysis and oxidative
phosphorylation and is sensitive to lactate levels.
Lactate produced from glycolysis can yield lactyl-
CoA, which can affect histone lactylation [137, 138]
and may promote histone H3K27 acetylation [139].
Aberrant lactate production and/or regulation in
patients with ME/CFS presents as elevated lac-
tate levels that have been confirmed both system-
ically (and linked to the severity of PEM) [140],
and locally in various regions of the brain [24].
The cause of lactate deregulation in ME/CFS is
not fully understood, though in vitro experiments
have demonstrated that serum factors in severe
ME/CFS can induce excessive lactate secretion
and elevated mitochondrial respiration [141].

JIM Epigenetics and latent viruses in ME/CFS / E. Apostolou and A. Rosén

Collectively, studies on viruses and ME/CFS sug-
gest that both the viral activity itself and the
immune response may contribute to the symp-
tomatology of ME/CFS. Herpesviruses can acquire
epigenetic control of their own genomes, but they
also alter the epigenetic landscape of the host
immune cells [107]. Chronic/Recurrent viral infec-
tion may stand as a long-term driving force for epi-
genetic reprograming, which ultimately may lead
to immune cell exhaustion, tolerance, and anergy,
rendering the host more vulnerable to subsequent
infectious triggers [142].

Human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) and ME/CFS

Human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) are
retroelements that have been acquired during
human evolution and comprise a significant por-
tion (8%) of the human genome. Although HERVs
are replication deficient, epigenetic, or transcrip-
tional activity of endogenous retroelements is evi-
dent both in vitro and in human samples [143].
The activation of HERVs in response to exogenous
viral infections—including herpesviruses such as
EBV—has been documented [144-146] and has
garnered renewed interest amid the COVID-19
pandemic. Transcriptional activation of HERVs
has been proposed following SARS-CoV-2 infec-
tion [147-151], and potential implications for long
COVID patients have been suggested [152].

HERVs have emerged as a significant source
of cell type-specific regulatory elements, includ-
ing promoters, enhancers, chromatin boundary
elements, and regulatory RNAs. They play a
notable role in regulating immune responses,
acting as enhancers and promoters, particularly
in interferon-stimulated genes. They constitute a
substantial proportion (15%-30%) of enhancers
in immune cells, and their regulatory elements
are enriched in chromatin landscapes associated
with immune cells and immune responses [153].
Moreover, HERVs can function as non-coding reg-
ulatory RNAs, such as IncRNAs, derived from
HERV insertions and implicated in the evolution of
non-functional alternative isoforms of genes they
promote, potentially regulating protein function
through decoy isoforms [153]. The dysregulation of
HERVs suggests broader regulatory consequences,
though not limited to their pathological implica-
tions.

Transcriptional activity of HERVs (HERV-K genes)
was documented in PBMCs of individuals with

ME/CFS [154], whereas epigenetic studies have
demonstrated extensive alterations in methylation
patterns of non-coding genetic elements [155].
Serology data from our study also support the tran-
scriptional activation of HERV-K following SARS-
CoV-2 infection [54]. HERVs are kept silenced
through various epigenetic mechanisms—mainly
DNAm and chromatin modifications—and tran-
scriptional activation has been linked to various
immune, neurodegenerative diseases, and cancer
156]. However, it is not clear whether HERV acti-
vation precedes and contributes to pathology or if it
is a bystander effect of the disease state. The viral-
like nature of HERV-derived products (DNA, RNA,
and proteins) allows them to be recognized by dif-
erent pattern recognition receptors and induces
innate immune responses [157]. Moreover, spe-
cific HERVs (e.g., HERV-K18 and HERV-W) can
act as superantigens, causing non-antigen-specific
immune hyperactivation that, in the long term,
may contribute to immune exhaustion and T-cell
unresponsiveness (anergy) [146, 158]. Immuno-
logical abnormalities reported in ME/CFS are
consistent with this contradictory co-existence of
immune hyperdrive and incompetence. At the
same time, HERV expression could be detrimen-
tal for the brain due to the toxic effect of HERV
envelope proteins on mature neurons, potentially
leading to neurocognitive pathologies [159, 160]. A
plausible scenario could be that HERV activation—
driven by the requirement of reinforced immune
responses—has a collateral effect on the cognitive
and neurologic abnormalities in ME/CFS [156].

Epigenetic reprograming in long COVID

The clinical overlap between ME/CFS and long
COVID [7] stresses the role of viral infections in
ME/CFS initiation and chronicity. The etiology of
long COVID, which can be confidently attributed
to SARS-CoV-2 infection, further consolidates the
role of viruses in the pathogenesis of post-viral
fatigue syndromes such as ME/CFS. It is esti-
mated that ongoing symptoms impairing func-
tional mobility persisted in 43% of individuals fol-
lowing acute COVID-19 for at least 6 months [161],
over 40% of cases remained with persistent symp-
toms at 18 months [162], and in approximately
30% of cases for at least 2 years after acute infec-
tion [163]. ME/CFS and long COVID share many
underlying abnormalities, and among people with
persistent, debilitating symptoms following acute
COVID-19, an estimated 13%-45% meet the diag-
nostic criteria for ME/CFS [164].

Research into the epigenetics of long COVID is lim-
ited in scope. In a study by Lee et al. [165], the anal-
ysis of DNAm profiles of long COVID and COVID-19
convalescent cases reported nonsignificant differ-
ences. Conversely, in our study by Nikesjé et al.
[166], DNAm patterns in long COVID patients
and COVID-19 convalescents demonstrated a dis-
tinct DNAm signature in the long COVID group
that related to alterations in pathways involved
in angiotensin II and muscarinic receptor sig-
naling, and protein-protein interaction networks
associated with vesicle formation and mitochon-
drial function. Transcriptomic analysis in patients
referred to a long COVID clinic revealed over 400
genes with altered expression compared to conva-
lescents with no prolonged symptoms [167]. Addi-
tionally, accelerated epigenetic aging has been
associated with the risk and severity of SARS-CoV-
2 infection, indicating its potential contribution
to the development of post-COVID-19 syndrome
among survivors [168]. The etiology of long-lasting
symptoms in long COVID, which frequently resem-
ble those in ME/CFS, is still elusive. Evidence for
EBV reactivation in long COVID patients is lim-
ited [169], and in most of the studies, it remains
only correlative [170-172]. Still, the effects of active
EBV infection could be a potential mechanism con-
tributing to perturbation of immune responses in
long COVID [173], potentially involving epigenetic
mechanisms.

Limitations of epigenetic studies in ME/CFS

A significant limitation in ME/CFS epigenetic stud-
ies stems from the clinical case definitions used for
patient diagnosis and study inclusions. Although
some studies employ stricter criteria such as
the Canadian Consensus Criteria [1], most have
utilized the Fukuda criteria [174], which lack
key symptoms such as PEM and neurocogni-
tive dysfunction, potentially leading to the inclu-
sion of patients with psychiatric disorders [175].
ME/CFS’s inherent heterogeneity—with varying
disease severity, duration, trigger, and comor-
bidities (such as FM, postural orthostatic tachy-
cardia syndrome, inflammatory bowel syndrome,
Hashimoto thyroiditis, hypermobility, and Ehlers—
Danlos syndrome) [3, 176]—further complicates
epigenetic signatures. Although there is currently
no consensus on ME/CFS patient stratification,
it is important to take into consideration these
factors in the interpretation of epigenetic pat-
terns. Additionally, the condition’s sex bias toward
females [177] has led to predominantly female

study cohorts, potentially introducing bias. The
diversity of sample types used adds complexity to
the identification of collective findings from epige-
netic analysis. Small sample sizes, regional vari-
ations, and differences in analytical methods and
statistical thresholds also contribute to the vari-
ability in collected data, highlighting the need for
arger, more standardized, and targeted studies.

Conclusion

The epigenetic landscape in ME/CFS reflects the
heterogeneity and varying severity of the symp-
tomatology observed among patients. ME/CFS,
ike most chronic diseases, arises from an underly-
ing genetic predisposition combined with environ-
mental triggers that disrupt the patient’s health
baseline. Following the initial trigger, the disease
progresses to a chronic state with intermittent
relapses and partial recovery, rendering patients
more susceptible to subsequent environmental
triggers.

The prolonged nature of epigenetic changes implies
that the primary trigger of transcriptional regu-
lation does not need to be constantly present.
Virally induced epigenetic changes may persist in
the absence of continued viral triggers, as in the
case of viral latency (i.e., herpesviruses in ME/CFS)
and/or after clearance of the viral genome (follow-
ing SARS-CoV-2 infection in long COVID cases).
Such epigenetic changes could have lasting effects
on the deterioration of cellular processes such
as immune responses and cellular metabolism.
Although immune suppression temporarily lim-
its the casualties of an overly exuberant immune
response, in the long run, it makes individuals
more susceptible to secondary infectious triggers.
In this scenario, virally induced epigenetic changes
may provide a rational explanation for a “hit-and-
run” model of infectious-triggered ME/CFS and
ong COVID.

Epigenetic mechanisms are imperative in deter-
mining the outcome of host-virus interactions.
Latent viruses such as EBV, which follow a biva-
ent lifecycle of latency and reactivation, succeed
in persisting life-long in the host by modulating the
host epigenome and by acquiring their own epige-
netic features. In the context of ME/CFS, in which
the viral activity of EBV and other herpesviruses is
prominent, the investigation of the epigenetic pro-
files of both host and viral genes is thus crucial.

physiological changes, such as symptom diversity
and severity, could provide insights into the under-
lying pathology of ME/CFS.

Currently, there is no standard treatment for
ME/CFS patients. However, a few treatment
approaches, either in clinical trials or off-label ther-
apies, have shown encouraging results and sig-
nificant improvement, albeit in certain subsets of
patients [2]. Epigenetic studies could be a key
parameter in patient subtyping, facilitating the
determination of the appropriate interventions to
target those ME/CFS subgroups that could benefit
the most.

Abstract

We recently reported the COVID-19-induced circulating leukocytes DNA methylation profile. Here, we hypothesized
that some of these genes would persist differentially methylated after disease resolution. Fifteen participants previ-
ously hospitalized for SARS-CoV-2 infection were epityped one year after discharge. Of the 1505 acute illness-induced
differentially methylated regions (DMRs) previously identified, we found 71 regions with persisted differentially meth-
ylated, with an average of 7 serial CpG positions per DMR. Sixty-four DMRs persisted hypermethylated, and 7 DMR
persisted hypomethylated. These data are the first reported evidence that DNA methylation changes in circulating

leukocytes endure long after recovery from acute illness.
Keywords: COVID-19, DNA methylation, SARS, PASC

Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic has caused 6 million deaths
worldwide. Many COVID-19 survivors fail to recover
their pre-infection status, with lasting physical impair-
ments and increased risk of cardiovascular events [1].
The pathophysiology of Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-
CoV-2 Infection (PASC) is poorly understood, and instru-
ments commonly used in clinical practice to assess organ
function fail to correlate with patient-reported symp-
toms. Identification of biological mechanisms underpin-
ning persistent deficits will accelerate research to better
understand, predict, and manage PASC. Because an
organism's cells share identical genetic information, dif-
ferent phenotypes are established and maintained by
epigenetic mechanisms [2]. DNA methylation is a cova-
lent yet dynamic epigenetic modification that influences

gene expression profiles, especially when present in gene
promoter regions [2]. Differentially methylated regions
(DMRs) comprise serial cytosine—guanine dinucleotide
(CpG) positions that are consecutively hyper- or hypo-
methylated and can persist over long periods of time [3].
Accordingly, DNA methylation is a plausible mechanism
to maintain an abnormal cellular phenotype after resolu-
tion of acute disease. Because PASC is caused by prior
SARS-CoV-2 infection and host inflammatory responses,
circulating leukocytes are attractive targets to investigate
differential DNA methylation induced by acute infection.
We have shown that SARS-CoV-2 infection disrupts the
circulating leukocyte DNA methylome [4] and transcrip-
tome [5] in correlation with disease severity spanning full
recovery to death. We found that SARS-CoV-2 infection
is characterized by 1505 DMRs compared to healthy con-
trol individuals, and gene ontological analysis indicates
that these genes participate in immune responses, leu-
kocyte activation, viral responses, and related processes.
Thus, we reasoned that a subset of these SARS-CoV-2
DMRs could endure long after recovery from COVID-19.

Methods

To investigate this hypothesis, all the participants
from our original cohort who survived COVID-19
hospitalization between March and April 2020 were
recontacted 1 year after discharge (Fig. 1A, B). Spe-
cific description of the cohort can be found in previous
publications [4—6]. Fifteen patients out of the original
102 participants and corresponding to 30% of surviv-
ing individuals consented to a second office visit for
clinical evaluation and a new blood sample for further
analysis. Upon evaluation, these patients expressed
multiple PASC symptoms including fatigue, sleep dis-
turbances, and reduced general heath scores. However,
they denied dyspnea and showed normal hemoglobin
oxygen saturation while breathing ambient air. Leu-
kocyte DNA was purified and bisulfite-converted for
DNA methylation analysis using the Infinitum Human
MethylationEPIC 850K BeadChip on an IIlumina®
platform. Genome-wide leukocyte DNA methylation
status was compared to samples from 39 healthy vol-
unteers which were analyzed with the same platform
as previously reported [4]. These healthy volunteers
were enrolled before the current pandemic, ruling
out possible differential DNA methylation caused by
asymptomatic COVID-19 infection, and were older
than the SARS-CoV-2 patients (78 vs 51 years old,
respectively); other characteristics are presented in
Fig. 1B. The specific comparisons made to identify the
persistent DMRs are shown by the Venn diagram in
panel A of the figure. To adjust for batch effects, and
given that these were patient-matched specimens, the
model used for differential methylation was adjusted
for patient ID. Following model selection, R packages
ComBat and SVA were employed to adjust for known
batch effects and latent confounding variables, respec-
tively, and were adjusted for in the model. Differential
methylation analysis was then performed as recently
reported [4].

Results

Of the 1505 acute illness induced DMRs we previously
identified [4], 71 DMRs persisted significantly differen-
tially methylated 1 year thereafter, with an average of 7
serial CpG positions per DMR. Sixty-four DMRs per-
sisted hypermethylated, and 7 DMR persisted hypo-
methylated (p< 0.0001). Over 90 % of the lasting DMRs
were located near or within gene promoter regions
(Fig. 1C), suggesting an effect on gene expression regu-
lation [2]. DMRs were uniformly distributed along the
entire genome (Fig. 1D). Gene ontological (GO) enrich-
ment analysis of the genes harboring the lasting DMRs
included pathways related to viral responses and inflam-
mation (Fig. 1E), see also accession numbers GSE174818
and GSE197152. For details regarding the specific genes
that persist dysregulated one year after hospital discharge
and their corresponding chromosomal location, see

Discussion

More than 6 million deaths have been attributed to
COVID-19, primarily arising from acute respiratory fail-
ure [7]. Recent data indicate that disease severity pre-
dominantly depends on host factors [8, 9], supporting
the need to better differentiate individual responses at
the molecular level. We and others have described out-
come-specific multi-omic profiles of COVID-19 patients
[4, 5, 10]. However, specific host mechanisms that coor-
dinate expression of these profiles are unresolved. While
an individual’s nucleated cells share identical genomic
sequences, distinct cellular phenotypes are established
and maintained by epigenetic mechanisms [11, 12],
including DNA methylation, histone and chromatin
modifications, and non-coding RNA transcription [2].
DNA methylation regulates gene expression and is sensi-
tive to environmental factors [2, 13-17]. Methylation of
CpGs located in promoter regions is canonically associ-
ated with transcriptional repression [2]. Mechanistically,

genomic features in percent. 5‘UTR=5’ untranslated region. In keeping with the known role of DNA methylation in regulation of gene expression,

a preponderance of DMRs is in gene promoter regions. D Circos plot shows the genomic distribution of differentially methylated regions (DMRs)
across the human genome (outer ring). Each chromosome is shown as a different color. Relative chromosome size is denoted by the arc bar length
(inner rings). Hyper-methylated DMRs are shown in red, and hypo-methylated regions are shown in blue. Sex chromosomes were omitted from the
analysis. These results indicate that 71 DNA regions persist differentially methylated one year after hospital discharge in reference to a pre-pandemic
healthy control cohort. E Bar graph of the top 10 gene ontological (GO) processes related to the SARS-CoV-2-associated differentially methylated
genes that persist abnormal one year after hospital discharge ordered by statistical significance. The X-axis provides the number of SARS-CoV-2
DMR-associated genes that contribute to each GO term. Bar color indicates the FDR P-value by using a Fischer test. These results indicate that the
observed DMRs occur in genes that participate in process such as response to virus, regulation of immune processes and others.

methylated CpGs recruit complexes containing methyl-
CpG binding domain proteins and other factors that
aggregate into multiprotein repressive complexes to
silence transcription [18, 19]. Critically ill patients have
altered circulating blood DNA methylation profiles [20,
21], consistent with epigenetic regulation of gene expres-
sion. We have recently reported a genome-wide DNA
methylation analysis of patients with COVID-19 in cor-
relation with clinical outcomes spanning full recovery
to death, and multiple sources have reported that DNA
methylation is relevant in the pathophysiology of acute
COVID-19 infection [22-24]. These findings introduce
evidence of acute epigenetic regulation of genes asso-
ciated with COVID-19 severity [4]. Although many
patients who survive COVID-19 develop long-term cog-
nitive and somatic dysfunctions [25], no pathobiological
processes that account for these lingering deficits have
been identified. We present here evidence that epigenetic
marks can persist beyond clinical resolution of acute ill-
ness. These data are the first reported evidence that DNA
methylation changes in circulating leukocytes endure
at least 1 year after recovery from acute COVID-19 ill-
ness, leaving durable marks in the methylome that may
condition patterns of gene expression that drive PASC
pathophysiology. Accordingly, DNA methylation may be
a mechanism regulating leukocyte adhesion and vascu-
lar injury and contribute to the recently described higher
risk of cardiovascular events after COVID-19 [1]. A limi-
tation of our study is that the age difference between the
healthy, pre-pandemic, and the SARS-CoV-2 cohorts.
Interestingly, recent evidence indicates that epigenetic
clocks are not accelerated by acute COVID-19 infection
[26], and the comparison between epigenetic and chron-
ological ages in our cohort has been found not signifi-
cant [4]. Other limitations of this study include the use
of a DNA methylation detection platform that targets
a limited number of CpGs (~4% of CpGs in the entire
methylome) and the relatively small cohort size. Future
studies comprising larger cohorts and whole-genome
methylation and RNA sequencing may serve to further
identify regions and transcripts that associate with, and
predict, PASC phenotypes and that contribute to disa-
bling COVID-19 sequelae.

Abstract

Background Aging has been reported as a major risk factor for severe symptoms and higher mortality rates

in COVID-19 patients. Molecular hallmarks such as epigenetic alterations and telomere attenuation reflect the biologi-
cal process of aging. Epigenetic clocks have been shown to be valuable tools for measuring biological age in various
tissues and samples. As such, these epigenetic clocks can determine accelerated biological aging and time-to-mor-
tality across various tissues. Previous reports have shown accelerated biological aging and telomere attrition accelera-
tion following SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the effect of accelerated epigenetic aging on outcome (death/recov-
ery) in COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has not been well investigated.

Results In this study, we measured DNA methylation age and telomere attrition in 87 severe COVID-19 cases

with ARDS under mechanical ventilation. Furthermore, we compared dynamic changes in epigenetic aging

across multiple time points until recovery or death. Epigenetic age was measured using the Horvath, Hannum,
DNAm skin and blood, GrimAge, and PhenoAge clocks, whereas telomere length was calculated using the surrogate
marker DNAmTL. Our analysis revealed significant accelerated epigenetic aging but no telomere attrition acceleration
in severe COVID-19 cases. In addition, we observed epigenetic age deceleration at inclusion versus end of follow-up
in recovered but not in deceased COVID-19 cases using certain clocks. When comparing dynamic changes in epige-
netic age acceleration (EAA), we detected higher EAA using both the Horvath and PhenoAge clocks in deceased ver-
sus recovered patients. The DNAmTL measurements revealed telomere attrition acceleration in deceased COVID-19
patients between inclusion and end of follow-up and a significant change in dynamic telomere attrition acceleration
when comparing patients who recovered versus those who died.

Conclusions EAA and telomere attrition acceleration were associated with treatment outcomes in hospital-
ized COVID-19 patients with ARDS. A better understanding of the long-term effects of EAA in COVID-19 patients
and how they might contribute to long COVID symptoms in recovered individuals is urgently needed.

Background
The global outbreak of COVID-19 resulted in a sig-
nificant public health crisis with wide-ranging impli-
cations. According to the World Health Organization,
over 767 million confirmed cases and 7 million deaths
have been attributed to COVID-19 as of July 2023
(https://covid19.who.int). COVID-19 is caused by an
enveloped single-stranded positive RNA virus known as
severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2),
which first emerged in Wuhan City, China, in late 2019
[1]. The main causes of death in patients with COVID-
19 are respiratory failure and multiorgan dysfunction
due to impaired immune response and uncontrolled
inflammatory processes [2]. Patients with severe types
of COVID-19 frequently experience respiratory fail-
ure and may often require mechanical ventilation [3].
Although the major signs and symptoms of COVID-19
are currently well known, there is increasing evidence
that the virus may have long-term effects and may
impact many different aspects of human health. Those
ongoing health problems following initial COVID-19
infection are commonly referred to as Long COVID or
Post-COVID Conditions [4].
Chronological age is one of the well-established
prognostic factors in patients with COVID-19 inde-
pendent of other age-related comorbidities such as
diabetes and cardiovascular diseases [5]. COVID-19
poses a disproportionate threat to older adults due to
the increased risk of disease severity, mortality rates,
and long-term consequences [6] in contrast to infants
and children who often exhibit milder clinical symp-
toms. Apart of aging, SARS-CoV-2 genomic mutations
in both untranslated regions and gene regions were also
reported to be associated with increased risk for severe
symptoms in COVID-19 patients [7]. Aging is a com-
plex biological process characterized by a progressive
decline in physiological function and increased disease
susceptibility. Aging is defined by specific hallmarks
such as genomic instability, loss of proteases, stem cell
exhaustion, telomere attrition, and epigenetic altera-
tions [8]. The most studied type of epigenetic alteration
is DNA methylation, which is an addition of a methyl
group to the 5 carbon position of the cytosine ring
to form 5-methylcytosine. This modification mainly
occurs within the context of a CpG dinucleotide and
is known to regulate gene expression [9]. DNA meth-
ylation signatures are known to be impacted by envi-
ronmental exposures and are strongly correlated with
aging in multiple tissues [10-12].

DNAm age often referred to as epigenetic age is a
measure of biological age based on DNA methylation of
specific CpG sites that reflect environmental exposures
and disease risks [13]. Epigenetic age acceleration has
been reported to be associated with multiple diseases
including cancer, diabetes, Alzheimer’s disease, HIV
infection, and certain progeroid syndromes [11, 13-16].
Several epigenetic clocks have been developed to esti-
mate epigenetic age [17], such as the pan-tissue Hor-
vath clock based on 353 CpGs [18], the PhenoAge clock
based on 513 CpGs [19], and the GrimAge based on
1030 CpGs associated with physiological and stress risk
factors [20]. In addition, DNA methylation biomark-
ers can be used to estimate telomere length, which is
another hallmark of aging. The DNAm telomere length
estimator (DNAmTL) is based on methylation meas-
urement of 140 CpG sites [21]. Recent research has
shown a potential link between COVID-19 and accel-
erated aging, as demonstrated by changes in the epige-
netic age [22]. Given the severity and global impact of
the COVID-19 pandemic, investigating the potential
influence of SARS-CoV-2 infection on accelerated bio-
logical aging is of significant public health relevance.
Studies have reported intriguing findings indicating
that COVID-19 patients exhibit accelerated epigenetic
aging compared to healthy individuals of similar chron-
ological age [22]. Furthermore, a significant accel-
eration of telomere attrition was observed comparing
healthy individuals versus COVID-19 patients. Severe
COVID-19 infection often leads to respiratory failure
requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation. A recent
study by Cao et al. reported accelerated epigenetic
aging to be associated with the severity of COVID-19;
however, the underlying mechanisms and the broader
implications of these observations remain poorly
understood [22]. Similarly, Chamberlain et al. recently
investigated the association between COVID-19 sever-
ity and biological age using two publicly available data-
sets. A lower biological age (measured via the Hannum
and PhenoAge clocks) compared to chronological age
was associated with reduced odds of COVID-19 sever-
ity. The authors also observed that PhenoAge was asso-
ciated with mortality in COVID-19 patients [23].

Our study aimed to comprehensively examine epi-
genetic age acceleration in COVID-19 patients with
acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and how it
relates to outcome (survival or death) following hospi-
talization. In addition, we studied dynamic epigenetic
aging across severe COVID-19 disease phases starting

from intensive care unit (ICU) admission until death
or recovery. The epigenetic age acceleration (EAA) was
calculated using several clocks including Horvath, Han-
num, DNAm skin and blood, GrimAge, and PhenoAge
clocks. Furthermore, telomere length was estimated via
the surrogate marker DNAmTL to elucidate the impact
of COVID-19 on telomere attrition.

Results

Epigenetic age acceleration in COVID-19 patients

at baseline

We measured epigenetic age using five different epi-
genetic clocks in whole blood samples collected from
87 hospitalized COVID-19 patients with ARDS under
mechanical ventilation at inclusion time-point T1 and
21 control samples. A strong positive correlation was

observed when comparing epigenetic age versus chrono-
logical age using the different clocks including Horvath
(r=0.87, p=2.5e—34), SkinBlood (r=0.92, p=6.3e—45),
Hannum (r=0.88, p=4.7e—36), PhenoAge (r=0.83,
p=1.2e—28), and GrimAge (r=0.93, p=7e—48) (Addi-
tional file 1). Our analysis on Epigenetic Age Accelera-
tion (EAA) in COVID-19 patients revealed significant
acceleration when compared to control samples in three
different epigenetic clocks: Hannum clock (p=0.0168),
PhenoAge clock (y=0.0048), and GrimAge clock
(p=0.002) after adjusting for BMI and gender (Fig. 1).

Epigenetic age acceleration in deceased and recovered
critically ill COVID-19 patients

In total, 78% of the COVID-19 patients (V=68) survived
and were discharged from ICU at different time points.

Patients who died were on average older compared to
those who recovered (p< 0.001) (Table 1).

In addition, they had a lower BMI, and were more likely
to have hypertension and chronic kidney disease, yet
the difference was not significant between both groups
(p>0.05). First, we measured EAA in the COVID-19
patients who recovered after being admitted to the ICU.
The initial analysis included 87 patients, of which 68 indi-
viduals survived and 19 died during treatment. Unfortu-
nately, the end of the follow-up time point was missing
in some of those individuals, leaving us with data from
50 COVID-19 survivors who had both time points avail-
able, along with data from 14 COVID-19 patients who
died in the ICU. We examined DNAmAge at inclusion
(T1) for the surviving COVID-19 patients and compared
it to their last recorded DNAmAge in the ICU before
recovery. Among the different epigenetic clocks used in
our study, the Horvath clock (y=0.0164), Hannum clock
(p<0.0001) and PhenoAge clock (p=0.0009) revealed
a significant decrease in EAA at the last recorded time-
point before recovery (Fig. 2).

Next, we measured EAA in the subset of 14 COVID-19
patients who died following ICU admission. Comparing

Page 4 of 11

DNAmAge at inclusion to the last recorded DNAmAge
before death revealed no significant EAA using the differ-
ent epigenetic clocks (Additional file 2).

We additionally compared DNAmAge in COVID-
19 patients who died to those who recovered at both
the baseline level and the final time point of follow-up.
This analysis revealed no EAA using different epigenetic
clocks apart of in the GrimAge clock (Fig. 3).

Longitudinal epigenetic age acceleration across disease
phases
Here, we used a linear mixed model to examine the
dynamic acceleration of epigenetic age over continu-
ous time points (T1-T5) of 50 COVID-19 patients who
survived and 14 who died. Our analysis of dynamic EAA
across these different time points showed no significant
difference between COVID-19 patients who survived
versus those who died following hospitalization in all of
the employed epigenetic clocks. We additionally com-
pared dynamic changes in EAA by calculating the dif-
ference between EAA at the end of follow-up and at
inclusion time points in both groups, which we defined
s “Change in AgeAcceleration” In this analysis, we

could observe a significant increase in EAA using both
the Horvath and the PhenoAge clocks (p=0.0415 and
0.0207, respectively) (Fig. 4, Additional file 3).

Telomere attrition in COVID-19 patients

We calculated telomere length using the surrogate
marker DNAm TL to compare accelerated telomere attri-
tion in the studied cohort. The initial analysis of COVID-
19 samples versus controls revealed no significant
difference in DNAmTL attrition (Fig. 5a).

When comparing telomere attrition acceleration
between inclusion and end of follow-up, we observed
no changes in DNAmTL attrition in the critically ill,
COVID-19 patients who

recovered. However, we

detected a significant DNAmTL attrition in the deceased
COVID-19 patients at the end-of-follow-up (y=0.0077)
indicating a measurable reduction in telomere length
in these individuals (Fig. 5b-e). Finally, we compared
dynamic differences in telomere attrition by calculating
the variable “Dynamic Change in TL attrition accelera-
tion” after subtracting TL attrition acceleration at inclu-
sion from the end of the follow-up. Comparing Dynamic
Change in TL attrition acceleration showed a significant
reduction in TL attrition acceleration in the deceased
COVID-19 patients between the two time-points
(p=0.0015; Fig. 5f). Nevertheless, when we applied a
mixed linear model over the continuous time points
(T1-T5) for TL attrition acceleration, we did not observe

Discussion

In this longitudinal study, we performed an epigenetic
age acceleration analysis in critically ill COVID-19
patients with ARDS receiving mechanical ventilation.
Overall, we observed an increased EAA in critically ill
COVID-19 patients compared to non-infected controls.
This EAA was detected using one of the first-generation
clocks (Hannum clock) as well as the second-generation
clocks (PhenoAge and GrimAge) [19, 20, 24]. Our find-
ings reveal increased EAA in individuals with severe
COVID-19 symptoms and ARDS. We subsequently
examined COVID-19 patients who survived and those

who died as distinct groups. Among survivors, we identi-
fied a decrease in EAA using the Horvath, Hannum, and
PhenoAge clocks at the last recorded timepoint before
recovery. In contrast, there was no significant change in
EAA between inclusion and the last recorded timepoint
before death among those who died.

A handful of studies reported an effect of viral infec-
tion including HIV and SARS-CoV-2 on epigenetic aging
[15, 25, 26]. Corley et al. first reported increased DNAm
age measured via the second-generation GrimAge clock
in severe COVID-19 cases. In contrast, Franzen et al.
did not observe EAA in hospitalized COVID-19 patients
with and without ARDS using four first-generation
DNAm age predictors [27, 28]. More recently, Cao et al.
reported accelerated epigenetic aging associated with

SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease sever-
ity. The study used multiple epigenetic clocks including
first- and second-generation clocks and looked at a large
cohort of 194 patients with mild/moderate symptoms
and 213 severe COVID-19 patients [22]. Their findings
align with our study’s observations, particularly for cer-
tain epigenetic clocks.

Furthermore, we could observe that reversing epi-
genetic age (i.e, epigenetic deceleration) measured by
the Horvath, Hannum, and PhenoAge clock is associ-
ated with recovery in severe COVID-19 patients follow-
ing hospitalization. In contrast, patients who died after
ICU admission did not show any differences in epige-
netic aging at inclusion to the last recorded DNAm age
before death. This indicates that COVID-19 alters epi-
genetic aging and decelerating this EAA would lead to
recovery following ICU admission. Recently, Poganik
et al. reported transient changes in epigenetic aging in
patients with severe COVID-19 and during surgery,
where patients exhibited an increase in biological aging
following exposure to stress that was later reversed after
recovery [29]. This aligns with the findings from our
study where EAA was reversed in patients that recovered
following hospitalization. Similarly, the previously men-
tioned study by Cao et al. analyzed dynamic changes in
EAA during multiple disease phases, where the authors
observed DNAm age acceleration at the initial phase of
infection to be partly reversed at the later convalescence
phase [22]. One crucial question is whether the observed
EAA is causally related to disease risk and severity or is
a consequence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this context,

a single Mendelian randomization study looked at the
causal relationship between COVID-19 and epigenetic
aging. However no causal association was observed
between epigenetic age and COVID-19 susceptibility
[30]. In addition, a recent study reported several signifi-
cant differentially methylated sites associated with aging
in COVID-19 patients including the ELOVL2 gene which
accounts for several CpG sites in the Hannum epigenetic
clock [31].

Interestingly, our study observed that COVID-19
patients who died following mechanical ventilation
exhibited significant telomere shortening at the last
recorded timepoint before death when compared to the
first timepoint at ICU admission. This suggests that criti-
cally ill patients with telomere attrition are more likely to
die during hospitalization. Similarly, dynamic change in
TL attrition acceleration between the end of follow-up
and inclusion revealed significant differences between
survived versus deceased patients. Despite conflicting
data, several studies including a meta-analyses showed
an increased risk for all-cause mortality to be associated
with shorter telomeres in the general population [32—
34]. It is important to mention that we could not iden-
tify differences in telomere attrition between COVID-19
patients and controls, which is in contrary to other stud-
ies reporting telomere shortening following SARS-CoV-2
infection [22, 35]. Similar to our study, Cao et al. used the
DNAmTL surrogate marker to measure telomere length
[22]. In contrast, Mongelli et al. employed a qPCR-based
assay for absolute telomere length quantification [35].
The output of DNAmTL is known to exhibit a moderately

qPCR or southern blotting in the blood [21]. However,
our findings align with the study of Franzen et al. where
lymphocytes from severe COVID-19 patients did not
show a significant acceleration of telomere attrition [28].
Regarding dynamic changes in EAA during disease
phases, the study by Cao et al. looked at a previously pub-
lished dataset of only six COVID-19 cases and six unin-
fected controls [22, 36]. To our knowledge, our study is the
first to look at EAA following a longitudinal follow-up of
several severe COVID-19 cases with ARDS and to deter-
mine the relationship between EAA/Telomere attrition
and outcome (survival or death). Nevertheless, one of the

main limitations of this study is the lower number of non-
COVID controls (N=21) and the limited number of stud-
ied samples who died following ICU admission. Only 14
deceased COVID-19 individuals longitudinally followed
during hospitalization were included in this study. In addi-
tion, we could only determine an association between
accelerated epigenetic aging and COVID-19. However,
understanding the causal relationship between them was
outside the scope of the current study.

Conclusion

In conclusion, we demonstrate that severe COVID-19 is
associated with a significant increase in DNA methyla-
tion age but not DNAm telomere attrition. In addition,
we could also detect an association between EAA and
recovery/death following hospitalization in COVID-19
patients. Similarly, an association between DNAm tel-
omere attrition and clinical outcome was also observed.
Future studies are required to explore whether epigenetic
age acceleration is causally linked to disease severity and
clinical outcome following hospitalization, along with the
underlying biological mechanisms behind this associa-
tion. Furthermore, understanding the long-term effects
and consequences of accelerated aging in recovered
COVID-19 patients is essential and urgently needed.

Methods

Ethical approval

The study is part of the “Immune Profiling of COVID-19
Patients Admitted to ICU study (IMPROVISE) (clini-
caltrial.gov identifier NCT0447313). The Institutional
Review Board at Hamad Medical Corporation (HMC)
and Weill-Cornell approved the study with record num-
bers MRC-05-007 and 20-00012. All research was con-
ducted in accordance with the ethical principles of the
Declaration of Helsinki. All participants enrolled in this
study or their legal guardians signed a consent form.

Participants

In total, this study included 100 critically ill COVID-19
patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
who received mechanical ventilation in the intensive care
unit (WHO clinical progression scale 7—9) [37], and 24
non-COVID controls from HMC blood donor unit. The
patients and controls were of similar ethnicity. Our previ-
ous study by Bradic et al. provides detailed inclusion and
exclusion criteria for the enrolled individuals [38]. Fol-
lowing their admission to the intensive care unit (ICU)
(Time point 1: T1), COVID-19 patients were monitored
at four different time points, including days 7 (T2), 14
(T3), 21 (T4), and 60 (T5). The follow-up was carried out
in accordance with the guidelines of the WHO Working
Group on the Common Outcome Measure Set for the
COVID-19 Clinical Research [37]. Blood samples were
collected at each time point unless the patients have died
or recovered at the end of the follow-up. Once patients
recovered, they were discharged from the ICU and there-
fore not included in any further analysis. Recovery was
defined as per WHO clinical criteria of less or equal to

Methylation array data processing

Samples were processed on the Illumina Infinium
MethylationEPIC Beadchip (EPIC array) which inter-
rogates > 850,000 CpG sites across the human genome
including extensive coverage of genes, promoters, CpG
Islands, and enhancers. Raw IDAT files for a total of 288
samples were obtained and processed further [38]. The
RnBeads package [39] was used for quality control, and
noob data normalization was performed using the minfi
package [40]. Following data filtration, 13 COVID-19
patients were excluded from further analysis since their
samples failed to meet quality criteria. Additionally,
three healthy donor samples were excluded. The subse-
quent analysis was conducted on a total of 87 COVID-19
patients and 21 healthy donors. After data normalization,
the methylation B value for each CpG site was extracted
and used as input to calculate the epigenetic age using
various clocks.

Epigenetic age calculation and DNAMTL estimation
DNAm age was estimated using various epigenetic clocks
such as the Horvath pan-tissue [18], PhenoAge [19],
GrimAge [20], and SkinandBlood [41] clocks via the
web-based epigenetic clock calculator (https://dnamage.
clockfoundation.org/). In addition, intrinsic epigenetic
age acceleration (IEAA) was measured since it reflects
epigenetic age independently of age-related changes
in blood composition [42]. Epigenetic age acceleration
(EAA) is defined as the deviation between epigenetic
age and chronological age. EAA was calculated based
on the residuals from regressing DNAm age on chrono-
logical age after correcting for BMI and gender. Further-
more, DNAmTL [21] was estimated where the deviation
between DNAm TL and chronological age is defined as
DNAm TL attrition acceleration. This measurement was
calculated by adjusting for BMI and gender as covariates.
All statistical analyses were performed using RStudio
version (2023.3.1) and Prism Software (version 9.51). The
R scripts used in this analysis are provided by the clock
foundation team at the following link: https://dnamage.
clockfoundation.org.

Statistical analysis

The correlations between DNAm age, DNAm TL, and
chronological age of the samples were evaluated using
Pearson correlation (R). To compare samples within
the same group (individuals who survived COVID-19
or individuals who died from COVID-19) at two dif-
ferent time points (T1 and end of follow-up), a paired
t-test was conducted. Additionally, an unpaired t-test
was employed to compare COVID-19 samples to control
samples, and to compare individuals who survived versus

--- Page 10 ---
Bejaoui et al. Clinical Epigenetics (2023) 15:186

those who died at the inclusion or at the end of the fol-
low-up period. A dynamic age acceleration linear mixed
model was conducted to assess changes in epigenetic age
in relation to survival status. The dependent variable in
the linear mixed model was the epigenetic age and the
independent variable was the survival outcome (survival
or death). Subsequently, statistical significance was evalu-
ated using a chi-square test. All statistical analyses were
performed using RStudio version (2023.3.1) and Prism
Software (version 9.51). p values<0.05 were considered

statistically significant.

Abstract

Background COVID-19 has a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations and given its impact on morbidity and mor-
tality, there is an unmet medical need to discover endogenous cellular and molecular biomarkers that predict the
expected clinical course of the disease. Recently, epigenetics and especially DNA methylation have been pointed out
as a promising tool for outcome prediction in several diseases.

Methods and results Using the Illumina Infinium Methylation EPIC BeadChip850kK, we investigated genome-wide
differences in DNA methylation in an Italian Cohort of patients with comorbidities and compared severe (n = 64) and
mild (123) prognosis. Results showed that the epigenetic signature, already present at the time of Hospital admission,
can significantly predict risk of severe outcomes. Further analyses provided evidence of an association between age
acceleration and a severe prognosis after COVID-19 infection. The burden of Stochastic Epigenetic Mutation (SEMs)
has been significantly increased in patients with poor prognosis. Results have been replicated in silico considering
COVID-19 negative subjects and available previously published datasets.

Conclusions Using original methylation data and taking advantage of already published datasets, we confirmed in
the blood that epigenetics is actively involved in immune response after COVID-19 infection, allowing the identifica-
tion of a specific signature able to discriminate the disease evolution. Furthermore, the study showed that epigenetic
drift and age acceleration are associated with severe prognosis. All these findings prove that host epigenetics under-
goes notable and specific rearrangements to respond to COVID-19 infection which can be used for a personalized,
timely, and targeted management of COVID-19 patients during the first stages of hospitalization.

Background

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2) virus was identified in Wuhan, China,
in late 2019 and has provoked an ongoing global pan-
demic of the resulting illness, COVID-19. COVID-19
has a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations, with
most infected subjects showing only mild symptoms or
being asymptomatic [1, 2]. The leading group of patients
with high mortality rates comprises those with severe
respiratory failure associated with acute respiratory dis-
tress syndrome (ARDS) and interstitial pneumonia: these
high-risk patients require early and prolonged support by
mechanical ventilation to compensate for their respira-
tory failure [3, 4]. The reasons for the heterogeneous clin-
ical repertoire of COVID-19 are mainly unknown. Only
three risk factors have been consistently related to life-
threatening COVID-19-associated respiratory failure:
male sex, old age and concomitant medical conditions,
such as diabetes, obesity, hypertension and cardiovas-
cular pathology [5, 6]. However, despite all these com-
ponents, there is significant inter-individual variability
in each demographic and epidemiological group. Thus,
given the immense impact of COVID-19 on morbidity
and mortality, there is an unmet medical need to discover
endogenous cellular and molecular biomarkers that pre-
dict the expected clinical course of the disease.

Based on this critical lack of knowledge regarding the
molecular mechanism underlying COVID-19 infection
response, recent epigenome-wide association studies
(EWAS) explored a particular layer of biological infor-
mation: the impact of epigenetic variation and in par-
ticular DNA methylation in establishing a severe clinical
course of COVID-19 disease [7-11]. These studies dem-
onstrated that epigenetics plays a central role in the
progression of COVID-19 through the identification of
specific methylation signatures associated with the severe
clinical evolution of the infection. However, there is only
a partial overlap between their results: this dissimilarity
is due to different choices in study design. For example,
the main differences concern the number of samples ana-
lyzed, the inclusion criteria used to enroll patients, and
the bioinformatics methods/strategies adopted to analyze
data. Bernardes and colleagues [8] performed a longi-
tudinal multi-omics approach but focused on the DNA
methylation profile of a limited number of patients. Also,
Zhou et al. analyzed a small cohort of patients stratify-
ing the methylation cohort into three groups: mild and
severe COVID-19 patients and healthy subjects. Balnis
and colleagues [7] improved the number of patients and
compared mild (non-ICU) and severe (ICU admitted)
vs healthy subjects obtaining a signature of 77 differen-
tially methylated positions associated with the degree of
severity of COVID-19. Konigsberg et al. [10] compared

Page 2 of 15

the methylation status of three groups of patients: SARS-
CoV-2-Positive, SARS-CoV-2-Negative, and subjects
with other respiratory infections. In Castro de Moura
et al. [9], only young patients without comorbidities were
enrolled. These studies shed light on different epigenetic
aspects underlying response to SARS-CoV-2 infection,
however, mainly not targeting high-risk patients. There is
still a lack of knowledge regarding the role of epigenetics
in characterizing severe outcomes in this specific patient
group.

Based on these considerations, we conducted a
genome-wide study using the Illumina 850 K Beadchip
on 190 blood samples from Italian COVID-19 patients
who were at high risk for comorbidities and clinical fac-
tors. The goal of this study was to identify epigenetic bio-
markers that could predict the clinical prognosis of these
patients and provide insights into the role of epigenetic
mechanisms in the evolution of COVID-19 severity.

Results
Description of patients
A total of 190 individuals (124 mild and 66 severe) were
initially processed. After the quality control step per-
formed both at probe and sample level a total of 187 sub-
jects (123 classified as mild and 64 classified as severe)
were considered for the analysis. The available clinical
data of these patients are summarized in Table 1 (detailed
information is provided in Additional File 1).
Considering the whole cohort males resulted more rep-
resented than females (63.6% males vs. 36.4% females).
The two groups showed slight but not significant dif-
ferences in the male/female ratio (Fisher’s exact test,
p=0.109). No significant differences in age were also
observed between the two cohorts (Mann-Whitney
test, p=0.2). Severe patients who died after admission
to ICU were 11 (17.2%). Taking into account the pres-
ence of comorbidities, 88% of subjects had at least one
pathological condition; however, only diabetes showed
a significant difference between severe and mild groups
(p-value =2.4 x 10°).

Sample group-level differential methylation analysis

A sample group-level analysis was conducted using
RnBeads. The quality control and data preparation are
described in the methods section. To reduce the com-
plexity of the data, a principal component analysis
(PCA) was performed at different levels: CpG sites and
regions (such as genes, promoters, CpG islands, and til-
ing). This analysis was used to identify macro-variations
in the epigenetic characteristics of the sample groups.
We did not observe a strong separation between the two
groups for any considered region (variance explained:
Sites: PC1=34.5%, PC2=4.8%; Genes: PC1=31.1%,

Differential methylation analysis was conducted at site
evel adjusting for potential confounding factors. We per-
‘ormed a PCA considering critical confounding variables
such as age and cellular components estimation (obtained
rom Steve Horvath’s Epigenetic Clock) [12]. Among
the first 9 PCs capturing 90% of the variance, only PC1
resulted associated with the disease outcome (p=4.59e-
07) and was considered as covariate in the differential
methylation analysis. After multiple testing correction a
ist of 880 probes resulted differentially methylated: 448
were hyper-methylated, while the remaining 432 were
ypo-methylated. (Fig. 2) (the list of significant differen-
tially methylated CpG sites is provided in Additional File
2).

The functional annotation of 880 CpG sites identi-
fied several genes that are involved in immune response
and related biological processes and pathways. These
include SAMHD1, SETD2, IRF2, IL12B, TRIM8, NLRP3,
MAPK10, and PIK3CD, which are found within hyper-
methylated genes while, ARID5A, CD226, CD244, ILIR1,

STAT6 were annotated from hypo-methylated CpG sites
(Additional File 3).

No significant genome-wide results emerged from
the analysis conducted at the regional level considering
gene, promoters, CpG islands, tiling. Therefore, a prior-
itization approach through Over Representation Analy-
sis (ORA) and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)
was adopted considering the first 100 best ranked
differentially methylated genes. Concerning hyper-
methylated positions, the ORA revealed a significant
over representation of immune-related biological pro-
cesses, including, for example, immune system process
(GO:0002376; OR = 13, adj.p-value < 0.05), regulation of
T cell proliferation, activation, selection (GO:0046640;
GO:0050863; GO:0045058; adj.p-value < 0.05), negative
regulation of viral genome replication (GO:0045071),
regulation of leukocyte activation (GO:0002694),
positive regulation of interferon-gamma _ production
(GO:0032729). As regards the hypo-methylated posi-
tions, the over-representation analysis produced very
heterogeneous results, comprising suggestive pro-
cesses such as immune (GO: 0002523) or anti-inflam-
matory responses (GO: 0050727) (the list of enriched

Starting from the significant enrichment of cluster 4 in
atients with severe outcomes, we tried to identify the
differentially methylated probes with the highest pre-
dictive power. We then compared the 5 clusters to each
other to select the markers that were differentially meth-
ylated and specific to cluster 4. The analysis resulted in a
ist of 21 CpG sites, which were summarized using PCA
to obtain a principal component that could distinguish
between severe and mild patients. This information is
resented in Fig. 4.

The first principal component (PC1) captured a high
ercentage of variation (35.4%) and was able to distin-
guish the two groups showing a significant association
with severity (OR=2.55 (95% CI 1.9-3.5)). Further-
more, both severe and mild groups were compared with
a cohort of Covid negative subjects. The results showed
that the 21 CpG epi-signature was still able to distinguish
between patients with severe outcomes and COVID-neg-
ative subjects [OR=2.3 (95% CI 1.78-3.17)]. Conversely,
the epi-signature was not able to differentiate patients

with mild outcomes from COVID-negative subjects.
Results are reported in Table 2.

The 21 CpG site epi-signature was also validated using
additional replication cohorts from published datasets
available in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) reposi-
tory. We took advantage of two datasets (GSE167202 [10]
and GSE174818 [7]) and found that the results were con-
sistent with those obtained in this study (Table 2). In both
datasets, the logistic regression model demonstrated that
the epi-signature was significantly associated with severe
outcomes (PCA scatter plots are available in Additional
File 4).

Finally, we evaluated the effectiveness of the epi-signa-
ture when considering various clinical factors including
(i) host characteristics, (ii) comorbidities, (iii) biochemi-
cal measurements and accounting also for pharmaco-
logical treatments. We compared the results of the three
models obtained with and without the inclusion of the
epi-signature. The results showed that the models that
included the epi-signature were always significantly more
predictive, explaining a higher proportion of the variance
in severe outcomes. More specifically, when we included
the epi-signature in the model that took into account host
factors, the McFadden’s R-Squared model goodness index
increased from 0.06 to 0.37. Similarly, in the model that
considered comorbidities, the McFadden’s R-Squared
model goodness index increased from 0.11 to 0.37, and
in the model that considered biochemical values, it
increased from 0.15 to 0.37. Pharmacologic treatments
were considered as potential confounders and included
in the regression model, however, results excluded a rela-
tion between treatments and the epi-signature.

GrimAge epigenetic clock

To better understand the role of epigenetics in the pro-
gression of COVID-19, we examined age accelera-
tion using two epigenetic clocks developed by Horvath:

AgeAccelerationDiff, which measures the difference
between chronological age and epigenetic age, and Grim-
Age, an epigenetic clock known for its excellent predic-
tive ability when it comes to survival. As shown in the
Additional File 4, we did not find significant differences
between the mild and severe groups in terms of AgeAc-
celerationDiff (Mann—Whitney test, p=0.96), and this
result was also supported by the replication datasets
GSE167202 [10] (Mann-Whitney test, p=0.67) and
GSE174818 [7] (Mann-Whitney test, p=0.107) (Box-
plots are reported in the Additional File 4). However,
significant differences between the two groups emerged
when using the GrimAge clock. Specifically, the group
of patients with severe outcomes showed significantly
higher GrimAge values compared to the mild group
(Mann-Whitney test; p-value = 1.71 x 10°) (Fig. 5a).

Albeit with different significance, this trend was
also noted in the two validation datasets: GSE167202
(Mann-Whitney test, p=0.00625) and GSE174818
(Mann-Whitney test, p=0.02) (Fig. 5b, c, respectively).
Combining the statistical significance of AgeAccelGrim
differences between the three studies, a Fisher’s com-
bined Benjamini—Hochberg adjusted p-value equal to
4.67 x 10-” was obtained.

Stochastic epigenetic mutations (SEMs)

Epigenetic drift was investigated by analyzing the bur-
den of Stochastic Epigenetic Mutations (SEMs) [15-18].
A SEM at a specific CpG site was defined as an extreme
outlier in the distribution of DNA methylation values
across individuals. To identify SEMs, the distribution and
variability of methylation levels were first studied in con-
trol populations for all the probes. A reference interval

for methylation levels was then calculated for each probe
using the formula Q1-(3xIQR) and Q3+(3 x IQR).
Any extreme outliers, with methylation levels out-
side this interval, were identified as SEMs. Finally, for
each subject, all the SEMs were recorded in a new data
matrix, including whether they were hyper-methylated
or hypo-methylated. The method used for this analysis
is described in more detail in the materials and methods
section.

The burden of SEMs in the severe group was found
to be statistically higher than in the mild group. The
median burden of SEMs in the severe group was 2600
(IQR: 1148-4808) while the median burden in the mild
group was 1290 (IQR: 830.5—2875). A multiple regression
model that took into account sex and age as covariates
confirmed that this difference was statistically significant
(p =0.0281) (Fig. 6a).

The trend seen in the original dataset was also present
in the two replication datasets, but it was only statisti-
cally significant in one of them (GSE174818, p=0.0086).
In the other dataset (GSE167202), the trend was not sta-
tistically significant (py =0.13). Fisher’s method was then
used to analyze the combined results of all three studies
and assess their overall statistical significance. This analy-
sis yielded an adjusted p-value of 0.002.

The impact of epigenetic drift was studied in more
detail by dividing the SEMs into those that were hyper-
methylated and those that were hypomethylated. The
trend of differences between the groups was still evident
in the lists of hypermethylated SEMs, but statistical dif-
ferences were mainly found in the lists of hypomethylated
SEMs (Boxplots illustrating these results can be found in
Additional File 4).

Discussion

In this study, we investigated epigenetic differences that
may play a role in the development of severe COVID-
19 in a group of high-risk Italian patients (i-e., with high
prevalence of comorbidities). We identified a group of 21
epigenetic markers that were able to predict the risk of
severe outcomes, such as death or the need for mechani-
cal ventilation in the intensive care unit. To confirm the
validity of our findings, we also analyzed publicly avail-
able methylation datasets from other COVID-19 patient
groups, including GSE167202 [10] and GSE174818 [7],
which had a similar research design and enough clinical
information to classify patients as mild or severe using
our method.

The differential methylation analysis at the group level
took into account cellular heterogeneity or confound-
ers, highlighting 880 differentially methylated CpG sites
equally constituted by hyper- and hypo-methylation.
Functional annotation of the 880 CpG sites (Additional
File 3) pointed out several potentially relevant genes
involved in biological processes/pathways related to
immune response and already implicated in COVID-19
response.

Among the hypermethylated genes, it is worth men-
tioning SAMHD1 (SAM And HD Domain Containing
Deoxynucleoside Triphosphate Triphosphohydrolase
1), a gene that plays a role in the regulation of the innate
immune response. The encoded protein is upregulated
in asymptomatic subjects compared to severe COVID-
19 cases in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection [19]. In
addition, this molecule is reported to be involved in
the molecular mechanisms associated with neurologi-
cal complications related to COVID-19 [20]. Another

interesting gene is SETD2 (SET domain containing 2,
histone lysine methyltransferase), which enhances the
expression of some Interferon-Stimulated Genes (ISGs)
by depositing H3K36me3 on their promoters [21, 22].
IRF2 (interferon regulatory factor 2) codes for a mem-
ber of the interferon regulatory transcription factor (IRF)
family, which has been identified as a potential candidate
gene for SARS-CoV-2 gender susceptibility [23]. IL12B
(interleukin 12B) encodes a subunit of interleukin 12, a
cytokine that acts on T and natural killer cells by enhanc-
ing their lytic activity and stimulating the production of
IFN-gamma. It has been hypothesized that death from
COVID-19 may be associated with immunogenetic mark-
ers including IL12B, along with HLA-B, IL6, and IL10
[24]. TRIM8 (tripartite motif-containing 8) is suspected
to be an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase involved in multi-
ple biological processes, including the innate immune
(IFN-mediated) response [25-27]. Other genes that have
been annotated in public database KEGG for their role
in the COVID-19 pathway include NLRP3 (NLR family
pyrin domain containing 3), MAPK10 (mitogen-acti-
vated protein kinase 10), and PIK3CD (phosphatidylin-
ositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit delta).
Among the hypomethylated genes, several gene loci are
worth mentioning: ARID5A (AT-rich interaction domain
5A), which codes for a nucleic acid binding protein
involved in immune regulation and cellular homeostasis
[28]; CD226 (CD226 molecule), a glycoprotein expressed
on the surface of immune cells that has been linked to tis-
sue infiltration and organ dysfunction in severe COVID-
19 cases [29]; CD244, a transmembrane protein that acts
as a cell surface receptor on immune cells and has been
linked to decreased serum cytotoxic effector molecules in

--- Page 9 ---
Calzari et al. European Journal of Medical Research (2023) 28:81

severe COVID-19 cases [30]; IL1R1 (interleukin 1 recep-
tor type 1), a cytokine receptor involved in cytokine-
induced immune and inflammatory responses that has
been linked to cytokine storm and the risk of venous
thrombosis events among COVID-19 complications [31,
32]; STAT6 (signal transducer and activator of transcrip-
tion 6), a nuclear transcription factor that plays a role in
IL4-mediated biological responses and has been found to
be increased in the lungs of COVID-19 patients [33].
Furthermore, the gene over representation analysis
and the gene set enrichment analysis, conducted on the
100 best ranked differentially methylated genes also sup-
orted the functional annotation results uncovering an
epigenetic impairment of biological processes related to
the immune system regulation and interferon-response
athways (Additional File 4). The published genome-
wide epigenetic studies on COVID disease [7, 9, 10]
showed similar and consistent results. The 880 CpG sig-
nature was unable to distinguish all severe COVID-19
atients from mild subjects after unsupervised clustering
(Fig. 3) but a subgroup (G4), strongly enriched in severe
atients, clearly emerged. Focusing on clinical data of
severe patients enriching group 4 we did not observe
any significant association with clinical variables able to
explain such a clustering. A further analysis of this clus-
ter identified 21 specific CpG sites that were able to dis-
tinguish between clinical outcomes, along with the first
principal component (PC1) (Fig. 4). The scores of PC1
were then used to estimate the risk of developing a severe
outcome, and the logistic regression analysis showed a
significant association between PC1 scores and severe
outcomes [OR=2.55 (95% CI 1.9-3.5)]. The regression
model took into account important covariates such as
clinical factors and pharmacological treatments. Clini-
cal factors included host characteristics (such as gender,
age, and smoker status), comorbidities (such as obesity,
hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and pre-
existing cancer), and biochemical parameters (such as
elevated creatinine, reduced albumin, elevated aspartate
aminotransferase, elevated LDH, elevated C-reactive
protein, elevated d-dimer, elevated leukocyte count and,
elevated LDL levels). Pharmacological treatments were
divided into chronic treatments related to comorbidities
and therapeutic treatments administered in the hospital.
The regression model showed that neither pharmacologi-
cal treatments nor clinical variables affected the associa-
tion between the epi-signature and disease outcome. We
further compared the performance of three models for
predicting severe outcomes in patients considering: host
factors, comorbidities, and biochemical parameters with
the aim of verifying whether the epi-signature was able
to improve the model based only on clinical information.
In each case, we evaluated the models with and without

Page 9 of 15

the epi-signature by means of likelihood ratio testing
and McFadden’s pseudo-R squared. The results showed
that the models that also included the epi-signature were
always significantly more predictive, explaining a higher
proportion of the variance in severe outcomes.

One explanation for this result may lie in the type of
patients enrolled in the study. It is known that the pres-
ence of comorbidities plays a significant role in determin-
ing the risk of developing a severe form of the disease.
However, not all subjects with comorbidities or risk fac-
tors experience adverse events. The cohort selected in
this study mainly consists of fragile subjects with comor-
bidities, considered at high risk. In fact, the presence of
risk factors was so widespread that the analysis of clini-
cal data did not reveal any differences between the two
groups examined, with the exception of diabetes. The
results seem to indicate that epigenetics could be an
additional tool able to improve the ability to discriminate
and predict the severe outcome of the disease among
fragile subjects. Further strengthening these findings is
the observation of a higher grimage clock in patients with
more severe prognosis: it has been demonstrated that the
grimage clock, the epigenetic signature associated with
important mortality risk factors, was better at predicting
survival than the risk factors themselves.

Moreover, to evaluate the effectiveness of the 21 CpG
epi-signature, we compared patients with severe out-
comes and those with mild outcomes to a cohort of indi-
viduals, COVID-19 negative. The results confirmed that
the epi-signature was able to distinguish between the
group with severe COVID-19 outcomes and the COVID-
negative group [OR=2.3 (95% CI 1.78-3.17)]. However,
it was not able to differentiate between the group with
mild COVID-19 outcomes and the COVID-negative
group. This result suggests that the epi-signature may
be more specifically related to severe COVID-19 out-
comes and not influenced by the presence of COVID-19
infection. Finally, the predictive capacity was confirmed
by the efficiency in discriminating cases from controls
in two external validation datasets generated from raw
data downloaded from public repositories (GEO) which
gave consistent and similar odds ratio values GSE167202:
OR=1.4 (95% CI 1.19-1.68) and GSE174818: OR=1.69
(95% CI 1.34—2.23). Therefore we can hypothesize that
the signature of 21 CpG sites may be a valid measure in
predicting outcome.

The evidence of an epigenetic perturbation follow-
ing COVID-19 infection also emerges from subsequent
investigations conducted after the classical differential
methylation analysis.

When evaluating epigenetic markers used to esti-
mate the biological age [12] we observed a significantly
increased epigenetic age acceleration (DNAm GrimAge)

--- Page 10 ---
Calzari et al. European Journal of Medical Research (2023) 28:81

in COVID-19 severe cases compared to mild cases. A
significant DNAm GrimAge increase is unequivocally
present even after evaluating this variable in the two
independent GEO validation datasets (GSE167202 and
GSE174818) confirming the robustness of the results.
This increase occurs even if no appreciable differences
in patients’ chronological age between the two groups
were observed. The hypothesis of a strong relationship
between accelerated aging and COVID-19 also emerges
from literature data: for example, in Corley et al. [34], the
authors correlated the severity of COVID-19 phenotype
(with a higher risk of mortality) to a significant increase
in DNAm age, proposing the epigenetic clock estimates
(both Steve Horvath’s DNAmAge and Grimage) as the
main predictor of the disease evolution. In Ying et al. [35],
the authors investigated the causal relationship between
aging and COVID-19 by analyzing biological age-corre-
lated measurements, suggesting accelerated aging as the
cause of enhanced susceptibility to COVID-19 infection
and to severe forms of the disease. These results support
the hypothesis that epigenetic impairment plays a role in
the evolution of the COVID-19 disease.

Another piece of evidence proving epigenetic involve-
ment after COVID-19 infection emerges from the anal-
ysis of stochastic epigenetic mutations (SEMs) which
represent a robust biomarker of a possible epigenetic
drift and an effective indicator of the accumulation of
DNA damage related to environmental exposure [15].
In our study, severe COVID-19 patients show a higher
burden of SEMs than their mild counterparts, especially
hypo-methylations.

This analysis highlights another important aspect
related to epigenetics in COVID-19 patients, and the
result can be considered robust since we validated it in
other cohorts.

We are aware of the limitations and strengths of our
EWAS approach: concerning limitations, we limited the
analysis to whole blood as representative of the methyla-
tion status of the disease but additional studies in alter-
native tissues may be necessary to confirm results. In
addition, the presence of missing data amongst clinical
information may have reduced statistical power in some
analyses. To mitigate the effect of missing data and opti-
mize statistical power, we adopted the pairwise deletion
approach. Another limitation concerns the information
on medications and treatments. This information was
considered a potential confounder in the regression mod-
els and is reported in the Additional materials, however,
no conclusions could be drawn about the effect of medi-
cations on survival because the study was not designed
for this purpose. The reason is that we know that treat-
ments were decided based on clinical conditions and
therefore some associations may be biased.

Page 10 of 15

Concerning strengths, the study focused on patients
with high-risk clinical factors, enabling the evaluation
of an additional layer of epigenetic involvement and
improving the ability to explain the disease outcome. The
study also added further information by investigating
some innovative aspects such as the assessment of epige-
netic drift. Finally, the results were successfully replicated
in validation cohorts.

Conclusions

In conclusion, the present study confirms that DNA
methylation is involved in the progression of COVID-19
infection. The study extends the current knowledge about
the role of epigenetics in the evolution of COVID-19
infection: we focused on Italian patients with comorbidi-
ties who are more frequently hospitalized but, despite the
frailty burden at admission, may differ in terms of out-
comes (good vs poor). Results show that the epigenetic
signature already present at the time of admission can
predict the risk of severe outcomes in a significant man-
ner. Furthermore, our results were confirmed in a cohort
of Covid negative individuals as well as in already pub-
lished datasets. Finally, the study confirmed that epige-
netic drift and age acceleration are associated with severe
outcomes both in our as well as in other cohorts. These
results indicate an association between host epigenet-
ics and the progression of the disease, which appears
to reflect the subject’s state of frailty and the resulting
response to the infection itself. This information may
be useful for personalized, timely, and targeted treat-
ment of COVID-19 patients during the early stages of
hospitalization.

Methods

Study design/population

This is an observational study evaluating patients with
COVID-19 who were admitted to the COVID wards
after arriving at the emergency room from February to
December 2020. Blood samples and clinical data were
collected in the first stages after the COVID-19 attesta-
tion. Patients were clinically evaluated from admission to
the emergency room to hospitalization in the covid ward.
The severity of the disease outcome was determined by
evaluating the clinical evolution of COVID-19 patients:
66 subjects who developed a negative evolution (admitted
to intensive care unit or dead) were classified as “severe”
cases while 124 patients with a less inauspicious clinical
course (discharge at home or in other facilities with lower
intensity) were assigned to the “mild” group. Patients
hospitalized with an already compromised clinical condi-
tion (e.g., too low oxygen saturation levels) were filtered
out, while, to ensure the representation of the whole
spectrum of COVID-19 clinical presentation/evolution,

individuals presenting some risk factors associated with
comorbidities were accepted. Written informed con-
sent was obtained from all patients. After quality control
procedures, performed both at probe and sample level,
187 samples (123 classified as “mild” and 64 classified as
“severe”) resulted suitable for analysis. Clinical variables
known to be important risk factors associated with the
severe outcome were collected. Furthermore, DNA col-
lected before the pandemia obtained from a cohort of
75 gender-and age-matched subjects were analyzed and
considered as COVID-19 negative group.

Predictive model comparison (Clinical vs Epigenetic)

To address whether our epigenetic signature was able to
improve a clinical predictive model, we used all available
clinical risk factors such as host information, comorbidi-
ties and biochemical parameters to build a predictive
model, which was then compared to a new one obtained
by including the epigenetic signature of 21 CpGs (PC1
score). Clinical data are available in Additional File 1.
Specifically, we considered (i) the host factors (Gender
[36, 37], Age [6, 37-40], Smoking status [37, 39], Absence
of fever [37], (ii) comorbidities (Obesity [41, 42], Hyper-
tension [37, 43], Diabetes [37, 44], Cardiovascular Heart
Disease [37, 38], and Pre-existing cancer [45, 46], and (iii)
biochemical parameters (Elevated Creatinine (> 1.33 mg/
dL) [37], Reduced Albumine(<4 g/dL) [47], Elevated
AsT(>40 U/L) [37, 38], Elevated LDH(>245 mU/ml)
[37], Elevated C reactive protein(>8.2 mg/L) [48], Ele-
vated D-Dimer(> 1000 ng/mL) [37, 38], Elevated White
Cell Count (>4x109/L) [37], High Levels LDL [49].
Moreover, pharmacological treatments administered
during hospitalization and chronicle pharmacological
treatments for comorbidities were also considered. The
complete list of clinical and pharmacological variables is
reported in Additional File 1.

DNA extraction and quality control

Genomic DNA was extracted from whole blood sam-
ples using automatic equipment and a commercial kit
based on magnetic beads separation. First, 1.5 ul of total
genomic DNA was quantified using an N60 Implen Nan-
ophotometer. Next, DNAs were diluted to a theoretical
concentration of 20 ng/ul using a Tris-EDTA buffer (pH
8.0) and re-quantified to ensure the correct sample con-
centration. Finally, samples showing aberrant protein
(260/280) as well as organic compounds (230/260) ratios
were discarded or purified.

Bisulfite conversion and DNA methylation assay

Since methylated cytosine is genetically indistin-
guishable from the unmethylated, genomic DNA was
chemically treated with bisulfite to convert cytosine

Page 11 of 15

(C) residues to uracil (U) (thymine (T) after amplifica-
tion), but leaving 5-methylcytosine residues unaffected.
Only good-quality genomic DNA was used as input for
bisulfite conversion. 900 ng of good quality genomic
DNA were bisulfite converted using the EZ DNA Meth-
ylation Kit (Ref: D5001, Zymo Research Corporation)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Specific incu-
bation conditions (Illumina Protocol) were applied to
improve conversion efficiency. To evaluate conversion
yield, a single-strand quantification of bisulfite con-
verted DNA (bsDNA) was performed using an N60
Implen Nanophotometer. Fragmented or too diluted
DNA samples were discarded or reprocessed. 200 ng/
ul of bisulfite-converted DNA were used for hybridiza-
tion on Illumina Infinium Methylation EPIC BeadChip:
these Chips are designed to quantitatively profile the
methylation status of 850,000 sites across the genome
at single-nucleotide resolution. The samples were pro-
cessed according to the manufacturer’s protocols in a
semi-automated procedure. BeadChips were scanned
using the Illumina iScan scanner, a two-color laser
(532 nm/660 nm) fluorescent scanner with a 0.375 um
spatial resolution. The fluorescence intensities were
stored as intensity data files (*.idat) which can be used
as input for most of the available analysis software/
packages. The methylation score for each CpG site is
represented as $B values according to the fluorescent
intensity ratio between methylated and unmethylated
probes. B values may range between 0 (non methylated)
and 1 (completely methylated).

Average DNA methylation

Differences in the average DNA methylation level
between groups were evaluated by comparing the relative
distribution of beta values of a subset of 3773 loci clas-
sified as “Random Loci” in the Illumina manifest. The
results are discussed in the Additional File 4.

Blood cell type counts and biological age estimation

An estimate of the proportions of blood cells including
CDS8T cells, CD4T cells, natural killer (NK) cells, B cells,
monocytes, granulocytes, and others, was assessed using
the DNA Methylation Age Calculator analysis software
(https://dnamage.genetics.ucla.edu/) [12]. Estimations
were incorporated as covariates in the differential meth-
ylation analysis to adjust for confounding effects. DNA
methylation measures were also used to predict bio-
logical age using different approaches including the pan
tissue epigenetic clock by Horvath or DNAm-based bio-
marker of mortality “DNAm GrimAge” [50]. Details are
provided as Additional File 4.

Differential methylation analyses

We adopted a complementary strategy to explore
genome-wide methylation data by combining both
EWAS and Stochastic Epigenetic Mutations (SEMs)
analyses.

Concerning group-level comparison we took advantage
of the RnBeads package in the R environment [51]. Dif-
ferential methylation analysis was computed both at the
site- and region- [Genes, Promoters, CpG island, and Til-
ing (fixed 5 kb windows)] level, providing a comprehen-
sive evaluation of potential methylation differences.

Stochastic Epigenetic Mutation (SEM) analysis was
used as a complementary approach to estimate epi-
genetic drift at a single individual level. This analysis
method, developed by Gentilini et al. [15-18] is widely
used in several studies that provided evidence that the
number of SEMs correlates with several events such as
aging, X chromosome inactivation skewing in women,
hepatocellular carcinoma tumor staging, unhealthy expo-
sure such as cigarette smoking, alcohol intake, exposure
to toxicants, and finally with socioeconomic position,
lifestyle and habits. SEMs have been recognized as possi-
ble biomarkers of exposure-related accumulation of DNA
damage during lifespan [52].

a) Sample group analysis and quality control

Using its integrated modules, RnBeads [51] repre-
sents a powerful tool to perform quality control,
normalization, and exploratory (e.g., Principal Com-
ponent Analysis) steps on raw data as well as dif-
ferential methylation analysis on different regions
(genes, promoters, CpG islands, and tiling regions),
or ontology enrichment of differentially methylated
genes. SNP-enriched probes, unreliable measure-
ments, context-specific, and sex chromosome probes
were filtered out in the quality control step using the
Greedycut algorithm provided within the RnBeads
package. Signal intensities were normalized using
the BMIQ (Beta Mixture Quantile) normalization
method [53]. Differential methylation analyses were
conducted according to the paired sample groups
by computing p-values using the limma method for
the site level analysis. For the analysis of predefined
(Genes, promoters, CpG island, tiling) regions, a
combined p-value was calculated from the p-values
of single sites. To avoid potential confounding factors
(e.g., age, sex, cell composition, and batch), principal
component (PC) and correlation analyses were per-
formed to evaluate the association with both depend-
ent (degree of severity of the disease) and independ-
ent (methylation values) variables: according to these
analyses, associations were used as covariates in the

Page 12 of 15

differential methylation module. Prioritization of dif-
ferentially methylated genes was conducted by GO
Enrichment Analysis via RnBeads using an algorithm
(GOstats) based on a hypergeometric test and the
hierarchical structure of the gene ontology database
(54]. Functional annotation was carried out using
the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Inte-
grated Discovery (DAVID) service [55, 56]. Prioriti-
zation of top ranked differentially methylated genes
was carried out using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis
(GSEA) [13, 14] through the WEB-based GEne SeT
AnaLysis Toolkit (WebGestalt - http://www.webge
stalt.org/).

b) Individual sample analysis [Stochastic epigenetic
mutations (SEMs)]

This method was applied to the single (individual)
methylation profiles to identify, through a non-par-
ametric statistical approach, single aberrant meth-
ylation values (extreme outliers—SEMs) according
to a reference methylation range (obtained from
the same reference subjects). Stochastic Epigenetic
Mutations (SEMs) were identified as aberrant beta-
values (defined as extreme outliers) falling outside a
reference methylation range obtained by the meth-
ylation profiles of a reference population and calcu-
lated as follows: upper value = Q3+(k*IQR); lower
value=Q1-(k*IQR); where Q]1 is the first quartile, Q3
the third quartile, IQR (Interquartile range)=Q3-Q1
and k=3. For each case, extreme outlier values of sin-
gle methylation profiles were annotated and classified
as hyper-methylated or hypo-methylated to controls’
relative probe median values. The number of SEMs
was compared between the two groups to identify
potential differences in epigenetic drift. Moreover,
other potential relations between SEMs and other
clinical outcomes were also investigated. Quality con-
trol, pre-processing, and generation of the /-values
dataset was performed using the ChAMP R package
(Chip Analysis Methylation Pipeline) [57, 58] using a
BMIQ normalization method. Sites with a detection
p-value above 0.01 and a bead count <3 in at least 5%
of samples, non-GpG probes, potentially SNP affected
probes, probes aligning to multiple locations, and
related to X/Y chromosomes were filtered out. Sam-
ples with an aberrant number of SEMs were also dis-
carded.

Statistics

Pairwise deletion approach (available-case analysis) has
been adopted to manage missing data to minimize the
loss of information and optimize statistical power. The
Generalized Linear Regression (glm) model was adopted

--- Page 13 ---
Calzari et al. European Journal of Medical Research (2023) 28:81

to evaluate the differences of variables between severe
and mild groups.

The likelihood ratio test has been used to compare
regression models while McFadden’s pseudo-R squared
has been used to test model fits and predictive power.
Values were log10 transformed to address skewed/non-
normal data. Alternatively, the “Wilcox.test” function
provided in the R package “class” was also used. Kol-
mogorov—Smirnov test was adopted to compare the
average DNA methylation levels in the two groups. Gene
ontology enrichment analysis was carried out using the
R package GOstats, implemented in RnBeads modules
[54]. Unless otherwise stated, the statistical significance
threshold was set to 0.05.

Data visualization

Data/results were visualized using specific packages in
the R environment. The “ggplot2” package produced PCA
charts and boxplots. Heatmaps and Manhattan plots
using “pheatmap” and “gap” packages, respectively.

Abstract

Background The epigenetic status of patients 6-month post-COVID-19 infection remains largely unexplored. The
existence of long-COVID, or post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), suggests potential long-term
changes. Long-COVID includes symptoms like fatigue, neurological issues, and organ-related problems, regardless
of initial infection severity. The mechanisms behind long-COVID are unclear, but virus-induced epigenetic changes
could play a role.

Methods and results Our study explores the lasting epigenetic impacts of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We analyzed
genome-wide DNA methylation patterns in an Italian cohort of 96 patients 6 months after COVID-19 exposure, com-
paring them to 191 healthy controls. We identified 42 CpG sites with significant methylation differences (FDR < 0.05),
primarily within CpG islands and gene promoters. Dysregulated genes highlighted potential links to glutamate/
glutamine metabolism, which may be relevant to PASC symptoms. Key genes with potential significance to COVID-19
infection and long-term effects include GLUD1, ATP1A3, and ARRB2. Furthermore, Horvath's epigenetic clock showed
a slight but significant age acceleration in post-COVID-19 patients. We also observed a substantial increase in stochas-
tic epigenetic mutations (SEMs) in the post-COVID-19 group, implying potential epigenetic drift. SEM analysis identi-
fied 790 affected genes, indicating dysregulation in pathways related to insulin resistance, VEGF signaling, apoptosis,
hypoxia response, T-cell activation, and endothelin signaling.

Conclusions Our study provides valuable insights into the epigenetic consequences of COVID-19. Results suggest
possible associations with accelerated aging, epigenetic drift, and the disruption of critical biological pathways linked
to insulin resistance, immune response, and vascular health. Understanding these epigenetic changes could be cru-
cial for elucidating the complex mechanisms behind long-COVID and developing targeted therapeutic interventions.

Background

In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, a remark-
ably high number of individuals worldwide have been
affected. While the pathophysiology and immune
response to SARS-CoV-2 (the virus causing COVID-
19) infection have been extensively studied to predict
acute disease progression and prognosis [1—7], there is
limited knowledge about the long-term effects caused
to the host by the infection. The condition of persis-
tent clinical symptoms after the acute phase of infec-
tion is common to many viruses—e.g., Epstein—Barr
virus (EBV) [8, 9]; cytomegalovirus (CMV) [10, 11], and
human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) [12]—but in the case of
COVID-19, this condition takes on great significance
as it appears to affect a large percentage of individu-
als. The persistence of COVID-19 clinical symptoms for
at least 12 weeks or more (several months) is referred
to as post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection
(PASC) or long-COVID [13] affecting individuals with
both severe acute symptoms and those with mild or
asymptomatic disease progression [14]. These symp-
toms encompass organ (e.g., fatigue, post-exertional
malaise, headache, insomnia, tachycardia) and neuro-
logical (e.g., brain fog, memory/speech/language issues,
sleeping problems) manifestations [15, 16]. Estimating
the accurate prevalence of this condition proves to be
highly challenging, primarily because inherent stud-
ies are shaped by a wide array of variables, including
age, gender, ethnicity, the severity of acute symptoms,
the type of SARS-CoV-2 variant, follow-up durations,
viral load, the presence of concurrent medical condi-
tions, vaccination history, preexisting social, economic,
and medical factors, among others [17]. Among the
most updated meta-analyses, the prevalence is reported
between 30 and 60% [18-22]. Another meta-analysis
revealed that COVID-19 long-term symptoms are
slightly associated with older age and strongly associ-
ated with female sex and preexisting comorbidities
(e.g., diabetes and obesity) [23].

The exact causes of long-COVID are still being inves-
tigated, but some hypotheses have emerged over time.
SARS-Cov-2 can reach (via hematogenous spreading)
and infect cells of the central nervous system (CNS), pro-
ducing neuroinflammation [24]. It has also been hypoth-
esized that the SARS-CoV-2 virus may persist in specific
tissues long after the acute phase [13], leading to poten-
tial long-term health complications [25]. Disease risk
factors include cell death and immune dysfunction after
SARS-Cov-2 infection [26, 27], uncontrolled and persis-
tent release of cytokines [28, 29], multiple cell fusion in
infected organ (syncytia) [30, 31], autoantibodies causing
immunodeficiency (against type I IFN) [32, 33] or micro-
clots [33, 34], and persistent viral infection [35, 36].

The possibility that these dysfunctions are medi-
ated over time by epigenetic changes has been explored
through EWAS approaches in a limited number of stud-
ies capable of identifying specific epigenetic signatures
obtained by analyzing small cohorts of post-/long-
COVID-19 [37-39]. Lee and colleagues [38] investigated
DNA methylation changes in immune response-associ-
ated genes in post-COVID-19 patients (after 3 months
from the acute phase), identifying the gene IFI44L
(interferon-induced protein 44 like) as the primary tar-
get. IFI44L plays a critical role in antiviral and antibac-
terial activity. The study of [37] compared methylation
changes in the acute phase, and after one year, highlight-
ing the persistence of pathways related to viral response
and inflammation. The study performed by Nikesjo and
colleagues [39] found a unique DNAm signature in PACS
patients involving modified pathways related to angioten-
sin II and muscarinic receptor signaling and mitochon-
drial function.

Here, we present a genome-wide study using the Illu-
mina 850 K EPIC BeadChips of a large cohort of ninety-
six individuals whose blood samples were collected 6
months after COVID-19 infection. The follow-up exami-
nation has highlighted the presence of suggestive long-
term clinical features in twenty-eight patients. This study
aims to assess potential epigenetic changes 6 months
after COVID-19 exposure.

Results

Characteristics of the sample population

Demographic and clinical features, including age, sex,
and cellular components of subjects sampled 6 months
after the initial SARS-CoV-2 infection (cases) and healthy
subjects with no history of SARS-CoV-2 infection (ref-
erences), are summarized in Table 1. The age and sex
distributions of the sample population were analyzed to
understand the demographic profile of the participants:
The two cohorts differ statistically in terms of age dis-
tribution (Mann—Whitney test, p<0.05) and sex ratio
(Fisher’s exact test, p<0.05). The estimation of cellu-
lar components of peripheral blood obtained from the
EpiDISH package [40] was evaluated to explore any vari-
ations in the composition of blood samples between the
reference and the post-COVID-19 groups. The analy-
sis showed no significant differences in immune cell
composition.

Exploratory

We conducted an exploratory approach to investigate
the epigenetic differences between the two groups
(post-COVID-19 vs. reference) through a principal
component analysis (PCA) both at the CpG site and
region levels (genes, CpG islands, and promoter). The

analysis (Fig. 1) did not reveal distinct patterns of epi-
genetic variation between the two groups since the
patterns observed were almost overlapping, indicating
a lack of solid differences in DNA methylation at CpG
sites and regions between the two groups.

Differential methylation and over-representation (ORA)
analysis
The differential methylation analysis between the two
groups (post-COVID-19 vs reference) was performed
using linear models for microarray data (LIMMA) [41].
Confounding factors (sex, chronological age, and cellu-
lar component estimations) [40, 42] were considered by
adjusting for their effects in the analysis (see Methods
for details). Limma results are available as Supplemen-
tary File 1. At the site level, the study revealed a set of
42 CpG sites overlapping 53 genes exhibiting signifi-
cant differential methylation between the two groups
(FDR<0.05): 24 hypo-methylated (log2FC<0; AB<0)
and 18 hyper-methylated (log2FC > 0; Af > 0) (Fig. 2).
Genomic localization of the 42 deregulated CpG sites
showed a significant enrichment at the level of CpG
islands (OR=3.426, p-value = 1.58 x 10~*). In compari-
son, 18 out of 42 sites (43%) are functionally related
to promoter regions (TSS200, TSS1500, 5’UTR, and
1stExon) (data not shown).

Differentially methylated cytosines were annotated
with their corresponding genes for functional annotation
and prioritization (Supplementary File 1).

Over-representation analysis (methylGSA) revealed
KEGG pathways associated with amino acid metabolism,
including "Alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism"
(hsa00250) and "D-glutamine and D-glutamate metabo-
lism" (hsa00471), albeit with nominal significance (Sup-
plementary File 2).

Next, we focused on differently methylated genes to
determine their potential relevance to COVID infection
and symptoms associated with post-acute sequelae of
SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) by using the relevant key-
words (e.g., COVID-19, long-COVID, post-acute seque-
lae of SARS-CoV-2 infection; neuronal; inflammation,
virus infection); we ranked genes based on their most
suitable phenotype associations (VarElect) (Supplemen-
tary File 3). Among the top-rated genes to note: GLUD1
(glutamate dehydrogenase 1) (cg00167275; log2FC=1.5,
A$=0.31, FDR=1.66e-35), ATP1A3 (alpha 3 subunit
of the Na+/K+ATPase) (cg13628106; log2FC=-0.32,
AB=-0.16, FDR=3.2e-4), RNASEH2C (C subunit of
ribonuclease H) (cg25294185; log2FC=-0.82, AB=-0.04,
FDR=1.96e-12), SMAD2 (SMAD family member 2)
(cg05100634; log2FC=0.51, AB=0.02, FDR=9.4e-7),

gene ontology level, we identified a significant enrich-
ment at the level of cellular components (CC), primar-
ily involving GO terms related to the proper function
and structure of the Golgi apparatus (GO:0000139,
"Golgi membrane"; GO:0098791, "Golgi subcom-
partment"; GO:0044431, "Golgi apparatus part’;
GO:0005794"Golgi apparatus"; GO:0031984," organelle
subcompartment’).

At the regional level, the differential analysis revealed
significant epigenetic changes limited to a specific CpG
island region on chromosome 6 (chr6:41,068,476—
41069343) (adjusted p-value =0.006, diff.meth = + 1%).
This region encompasses the 3’ terminal portion of
NFYA (nuclear transcription factor Y subunit alpha)

and the first exon of the pseudogene ADCY10P1
(ADCY10 pseudogene 1).

Meta-analysis

To enhance the robustness and validation of our find-
ings, we conducted a comprehensive literature search
for analogous studies. After identifying the sole survey
with a similar design, we integrated our nominal p-val-
ues derived from the differential analysis of CpG sites
with those obtained from Lee and colleagues [38], who
conducted a comparison between COVID-19 positive
and negative cases, using a meta-analytical method. The
meta-analysis (Supplementary File 5) detected 13 signifi-
cant (FDR<0.05) CpG sites with identical directions of

effect/deregulation across the two datasets. This analy-
sis was conducted considering that there is indeed a dis-
crepancy between the two studies regarding the timing of
sample collection post-infection (6 months vs 3 months).
The thirteen genes associated to the 13 CpG sites are (in
order of significance): DYRK2 (dual-specificity tyros-
ine phosphorylation-regulated kinase 2), ATP5PF (ATP
synthase peripheral stalk subunit F6), B4GAT1 (beta-
1,4-glucuronyltransferase 1), PRKXP1 (PRKX Pseudo-
gene 1), SLC25A21-AS1 (SLC25A21 antisense RNA 1),
NRDC (nardilysin convertase), SMAD2 (SMAD Family
Member 2), OSBPL6 (oxysterol-binding protein like 6),
IFI44L (interferon-induced protein 44 like), PATJ(PATJ
Crumbs cell polarity complex component), PRH1-PRR4
(PRH1-PRR4 readthrough), and UBAC2 (UBA domain
containing 2). The thirteenth probe is located in an inter-
genic region and aligns simultaneously with two genes,
ACAN (Aggrecan) and ISG20 (interferon-stimulated
exonuclease gene 20).

Age acceleration

Methylation profiles were evaluated through Horvath’s
epigenetic clock tool to assess whether exposure to the
COVID-19 virus impacted biological age estimates. We
observed a slight but significant epigenetic age accelera-
tion (EAA) in post-COVID-19 patients across all available
clocks [42-45], (Horvath, p-value=3x10°3; Hannum,
p-value= < <0.05; PhenoAge, p-value=8.8 x 10-*, Skin-
Blood, p-value=2.7 x 107°) (Fig. 3 panels A, C, D, E).
On the contrary, despite an increasing trend, no signifi-
cant differences were found when evaluating the DNAm
GrimAge predictor of lifespan (linear regression adjusted
‘or covariates, p-value = 0.42) (Fig. 3B).

Moreover, we also assessed DNAmTLadjAge, a DNA
methylation-based estimator of telomere length [46].
DNAmTLadjAge corresponds to the age-adjusted
parameter that relates DNAmTL to chronological age.
Negative values of DNAmTLadjAge indicate DNAmTL
that is shorter than expected based on age, while positive
values indicate the opposite. Our analysis revealed that
DNAmTLadjAge was significantly lower in post-COVID
patients compared to controls. Results of linear regres-
sion adjusted for covariates: telomere length (DNAmTL)
(p-value < < 0.05).

Epigenetic drift

The assessment of epigenetic drift was carried out
through the identification of stochastic epigenetic muta-
tions (SEMs) as described in [3, 47-51]. To detect SEMs,
we first examined the distribution and variability of
methylation levels in the control population for all the
probes: A reference methylation range for each probe
was generated using the formula Q1-(3xXIQR)=lower

Page 6 of 15

limit and Q3+(3XIQR)=upper limit. Methylation lev-
els of cases falling outside this extreme interval were
identified as SEMs. Differences between cases and con-
trols were then investigated using two distinct metrics to
evaluate the epigenetic drift: one examining the broader
influence of SEMs (Global-Epi Mutation Load (EML)),
while the other focused on assessing the burden of SEMs
at the gene level (Gene-EML).

In the case cohort (Global-EML), the median value of
SEMs stood at 488.5, IQR (373-922), whereas in the ref-
erence group, it was 369, IQR (314—520.5). The multiple
regression model that accounted for sex and principal
component covariates, which included age and cellular
components, confirmed a significant increase of SEMs
in the post-COVID-19 group compared to the control/
reference group (with an estimated incremental log10
transformed value of 0.1667 and a p-value of 3.74.x 107°)
as shown in Fig. 4. The increase is confirmed even when
SEMs are hyper-methylated and hypo-methylated cat-
egories (data not shown).

Differences in Gene-EML between cases and controls
were investigated using a sequence kernel association test
(SKAT) [52]. After correction for appropriate covariates
(sex and principal components, as described for the dif-
ferential methylation step), the analysis identified 790
SEMs-enriched genes with statistically significant asso-
ciations with sample group variable (Perm P value < 0.05)
(Supplementary File 6). The roster of genes exhibiting
increased drift in cases underwent an over-representa-
tion analysis (Fig. 5) (Supplementary File 7).

ORA identified several enriched pathways, some
remaining significant even after multiple testing cor-
rections. Notably, the "Insulin resistance" pathway
(hsa04931) remained significant (FDR=0.04), alongside
the "VEGF signaling" pathway (hsa04370) and the "Apop-
tosis signaling pathway" (P00006) (FDR=0.005). Other
pathways, while not significant after correction, are note-
worthy, including "Hypoxia response via HIF activation,"
"Axon guidance mediated by netrin," "Relaxin signaling
pathway," "T-cell activation," and the "Endothelin signal-
ing pathway."

Discussion

This study aimed to investigate potential epigenetic
changes 6 months after COVID-19 exposure. Currently,
within this timeframe of exposure, it stands out as one
of the epigenetic studies with robust statistical power,
analyzing the methylation profile of nearly a hundred
individuals.

The role of DNA methylation in developing long-term
COVID-19 symptoms has been examined in three pre-
viously published studies [37-39]. However, these stud-
ies utilized diverse approaches, primarily focusing on

epigenetic remodeling or reprogramming in the host
organism.

The initial suggestive discovery reveals no discern-
ible variance in the immune system landscape between
the two groups, as evidenced by comparable estimates
of blood cellular composition (CD8T, CD4T, NK, Bcell,
Mono, Gran) (Supplementary File 8).

Although not directly comparing the same populations
at the same time point (3 months post-infection), [38]
confirmed the absence of an inflammatory state, as they
observed no significant differences in the various cell
types under consideration.

The principal component analysis (PCA) showed no
distinct patterns of epigenetic variation between the
two groups, indicating a lack of solid differences in DNA
methylation at CpG sites and regions (genes, promoters,
CpG islands) level. However, the differential methylation
analysis between the two groups revealed 42 CpG sites
exhibiting significant differential methylation. The over-
representation analysis highlighted a pathway related
to glutamate/glutamine metabolism. The dysregula-
tion of this pathway has been reported as significant in
COVID-19 since studies have shown that glutamine and
glutamate metabolism play a crucial role in COVID-19
severity, with elevated glutamate levels associated with an
increased risk of infection and severe disease. In contrast,
elevated glutamine levels are linked to a decreased risk
of infection and severe COVID-19 [53]. Moreover, the
functional prioritization analysis enabled the identifica-
tion of genes, including GLUD1, ATP1A3, RNASEH2C,
SMAD2, TNIP1, PRKCI, and ARRB2, which are par-
ticularly intriguing for their potential involvement in the

Page 8 of 15

neurological and immunological processes associated
with post-COVID symptoms.

Among the genes with the highest prioritization scores,
we identified GLUD1 (glutamate dehydrogenase 1),
which is interesting because it plays a role in maintain-
ing glutamate levels. The hyper-methylation of GLUD1
observed in this study aligns with the elevated levels of
glutamate resulting from systemic inflammation caused
by SARS-CoV-2 infection. This finding might contribute
to explaining a number of neurotoxic effects, contribut-
ing to neuronal dysfunctions such as altered learning,
memory, and neuroplasticity highlighted in post-COVID
patients [54, 55].

Additionally, after prioritization analysis, ATP1A3
(alpha three subunits of the Na+/K+ATPase) emerged
as another intriguing gene. Although not directly linked
to COVID-19, it has been associated with various neu-
rological disorders [56] and cardiac abnormalities [57],
suggesting a potential indirect role in the neurologi-
cal manifestations and cardiovascular complications
observed in some patients.

Emerging findings indicate that also the other genes,
RNASEH2C, SMAD2, TNP1, PRKCI, and ARRB2, may
lay a role in the pathophysiology of long-COVID by
influencing various aspects of the immune response,
inflammation, or cellular processes contributing to pro-
onged symptoms following COVID-19 infection. Muta-
tions in the C subunit of ribonuclease H (RNASEH2C),
‘or example, have been reported to affect the immune
response and potentially result in severe COVID-19 out-
comes [58, 59]. SMAD2 (SMAD family member 2) is a
rotein that plays a role in the TGF-£ signaling pathway,
which is involved in the regulation of cell growth, dif-
erentiation, and immune response [60]. Research has
shown that SMAD2, along with other genes like SMAD1
and SMAD3, plays a role in modulating T-cell immunity
and viral infection responses, contributing to symptoms
such as chronic inflammation and immune dysregulation
observed in long-COVID [61].

TNFAIP3 interacting protein 1 (TNIP1) is a hub pro-
tein associated with autoimmune diseases [62] and plays
a role in COVID-19. Research suggests that TNIP1 is
involved in the immune response and inflammation reg-
ulation, making it a potential target for therapeutic inter-
ventions in COVID-19 patients [63].

Among the latest interesting genes, we found PRKCI
and ARRB2. The PRKCI gene encodes a protein kinase
C iota (PKCi), which regulates cellular functions such
as cell proliferation, division, differentiation, survival,
migration, and polarization [64, 65]. On the other hand,
ARRB2, a member of the arrestin/beta-arrestin protein
family, is involved in desensitizing G-protein-coupled
receptors and regulating signaling pathways related to

cell proliferation, migration, and inflammation. Muta-
tions in ARRB2 have been linked to neurodegenerative
diseases [66, 67], cardiovascular alterations [68, 69], and
cancer [70]. Additionally, B-arrestin 2 promotes the pro-
duction of IFN-8 and virus clearance in macrophages,
although some viruses may degrade it to evade the
immune response [71]. Both ARRB2 and PRKCI regu-
late toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling, which is critical for
inducing inflammation in response to microbes and host
molecules.

An additional analysis aimed to boost the over-repre-
sentation analysis (ORA) sensitivity by incorporating
the first 200 nominally significant genes into the gene
list. This effort was made to capture potentially relevant

genetic factors that may enhance ORA accuracy. The
results revealed considerable enrichment in gene ontol-
ogy (GO) terms associated with "Golgi apparatus func-
tionality" under "cellular components." This finding is
noteworthy as it aligns with previous research indicating
that SARS-CoV-2 infection induces Golgi fragmentation,
which aids in viral trafficking and release [72]. Addition-
ally, Golgi fragmentation is commonly observed in brain
samples from individuals with Alzheimer’s disease and
can be triggered by excessive neuronal activation [73].
After concluding the differential methylation analy-
sis, the results were compared with those of a previ-
ous study using a meta-analytical approach to produce
a more reliable list of genes. This comparative analysis

--- Page 10 ---
Calzari et al. Clinical Epigenetics (2024) 16:112

identified 13 genes showing notably consistent epige-
netic differences among studies. Despite the differing
study designs, this gene list allows for a focus on more
robust results.

Furthermore, the study explored additional facets of
epigenetic regulation and investigated whether exposure
to the SARS-CoV-2 virus affected biological age and epi-
genetic drift.

We observed a slight but significant age acceleration

(AgeAccelerationDiff) and telomere shortening in post-
COVID-19 patients, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 virus
exposure might accelerate aging. The effects of viral
infections, specifically COVID-19, as well as immune
responses on the process of biological aging are cur-
rently a topic of debate: several studies have explored this
aspect among individuals with acute phase COVID-19,
examining both the comparison between healthy con-
trols and COVID-19 cases and the assessment of vary-
ing severity levels within the COVID-19 patient group,
comparing mild and severe cases. While specific studies
have shown no distinctions between chronological and
biological age [3, 74], others have observed an accelera-
tion [75]. In partial contrast to our findings, it is worth
noting the absence of this acceleration in Lee et al.,
2022 [38], where no significant differences are observed;
however, it is essential to consider that the time points
between our study (after 6 months) and Lee’s [38] (after
3 months) are pretty different. Telomere shortening is a
widely observed and confirmed aspect in the context of
COVID-19, as demonstrated in other studies involving
subjects with severe forms of the disease [75-77] and in
iost-COVID-19 survivors [78].
Another critical issue in understanding the biological
effects of COVID-19 virus infection after 6 months is
the results obtained by evaluating epigenetic drift. Epi-
genetic drift refers to the changes in DNA methylation
atterns that occur over time, contributing to aging. It
can be influenced by genetics and environmental expo-
sure, including viral infections, exerting an influence on
individual health by increasing genomic instability and
romoting abnormal gene expression [79]. Stochastic
epigenetic mutations (SEMs) can be considered a reli-
able measure of epigenetic drift [3, 50, 80]. For example,
the burden of SEMs was recently found to be associ-
ated with Parkinson's disease (referred to as epigenetic
mutation load) [81] or with amyotrophic lateral sclero-
sis [80]. Two different metrics have been used to assess
epigenetic drift: one that analyzed the broader impact of
SEMs (Global-EML) and another that concentrated on
evaluating the burden of SEMs at the gene level (Gene-
EML). Interestingly, our analyses showed a significantly
increased Global-EML in the post-COVID-19 group
compared to controls (Fig. 4).

Page 10 of 15

Moreover, to assess epigenetic drift at the gene level
(Gene-EML), we employed a sequence kernel associa-
tion test (SKAT). Designed initially for rare variant stud-
ies, this method has recently found applications in other
areas like copy number variations (CNVs) and epigenetic
modifications. It has been widely used in numerous stud-
ies aiming to identify genetic associations with diseases
such as Alzheimer’s disease, schizophrenia, and autism
spectrum disorder, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [80, 82—
84]. This analysis has identified a list of genes that exhibit
significantly different epigenetic drift between the two
study groups. The ORA analysis considering this list of
genes revealed several significantly enriched biochemical
pathways, most of which may directly or indirectly relate
to COVID-19.

The "VEGF signaling pathway" and "Hypoxia response
via HIF activation" pathways have been associated with
COVID-19 due to their involvement in vascular dysfunc-
tion and inflammation observed during disease progres-
sion [85, 86]. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)
plays a crucial role in angiogenesis and regulates various
activities such as vascular permeability, cell migration,
proliferation, and survival [87]. Hypoxia, or low oxygen
conditions, can activate the hypoxia-inducible factor
(HIF), a key regulator in the response to hypoxia. The
concurrent activation of HIF and proinflammatory sign-
aling leads to the upregulation of VEGF, which is elevated
in COVID-19 patients compared to healthy controls [88,
89] and significantly higher in patients with severe out-
comes compared to survivors [86, 90], suggesting that
extensive activation of endothelial cells significantly con-
tributes to disease progression. Unfortunately, we cannot
speculate on whether these pathways are up- or down-
regulated in our analysis; as for the SKAT analysis, we
considered overall epigenetic dysregulation by aggregat-
ing hyper- and hypo-methylated SEMs.

Moreover, pathways like "Insulin Resistance" and the
"Insulin/IGF pathway-protein kinase B signaling cascade"
could become relevant due to COVID-19’s association
with various metabolic alterations, such as impacts on
insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism. Studies have
shown that COVID-19 patients, even those with mild
cases, may experience increased insulin resistance, which
can persist long after the acute phase of the infection
{91}.

Another attractive deregulated pathway is represented
by the "Apoptosis signaling pathway"; this pathway plays
a central role in the pathogenesis of COVID-19, and its
dysregulation may also contribute to disease severity.
However, the role of apoptosis is very complex, and both
the induction and inhibition of apoptosis have been sug-
gested as potential therapeutic targets at different stages
of the disease [92].

--- Page 11 ---
Calzari et al. Clinical Epigenetics (2024) 16:112

The "T-cell receptor signaling pathway" and "T-cell
activation" pathways are highly suggestive concerning
COVID-19. These pathways are relevant because the
SARS-CoV-2 virus can directly impact the immune
response of T-cells. During COVID-19 infection, there
has been significant observed impact on T-cell popula-
tions and their activation, as T-cells play a crucial role
in the immune response against the virus: Longitudi-
nal studies [93, 94] show that immune abnormalities
may persist after a severe COVID-19 progression, with
sustained activation of myeloid cells, the presence of
proinflammatory cytokines, and consistently activated
T-cells still detectable between 8 to 12 months after
the initial COVID-19 infection.

In conclusion, these results provide comprehensive
insights into the epigenetic consequences of SARS-
CoV-2 exposure after 6 months, emphasizing potential
associations with aging, SEM accumulation, and dys-
regulation in critical pathways linked to insulin resist-
ance, immune response, and vascular function.

We emphasize, for completeness of information,
that an additional epigenetic analysis was conducted
considering the subcohort of 28 samples that exhib-
ited long-COVID symptoms. However, although
these results confirm the findings already highlighted
regarding the SARS-CoV-2 exposure factor, they
should be taken and interpreted with caution due to
the low sample size. The results of this additional anal-
ysis are reported in Supplementary File 9.

The study has some limitations Due to experimental
constraints, cases and controls were not perfectly bal-
anced on each BeadChip, necessitating careful evalu-
ation and correction for any potential batch effects.
To validate the results obtained from an EWAS (epi-
genome-wide association study), a biological replicate
of the experiment with a different validation cohort
would be necessary. Furthermore, although the sample
size may be considered large, it may still be insufficient
to detect very subtle differences between cohorts that
could prove significant in a genomic framework or
large genetic association study. However, it is essen-
tial to note that the analysis framework developed in
this study aims to apply not only the most commonly
adopted methods in the field of DNA methylation,
such as the study of age predictors and the analysis of
differential methylation, but also extends to less com-
mon analytical approaches by integrating the study of
epigenetic drift and pathways enriched in genes sig-
nificantly enriched in stochastic epigenetic mutations.

Materials and methods

Patient recruitment and study design

This study, conducted across multiple centers, intended
to examine the long-term effects of COVID-19 by assess-
ing ninety-six individuals 6 months after they con-
tracted the virus (years 2020 and 2021). Inclusion criteria
encompassed hospitalization during the infection period,
with a subgroup of patients requiring intensive care unit
admission and the use of forced ventilation. As a refer-
ence methylation profile, a control group of 191 selected
individuals from an unrelated study with no history of
COVID-19 (confirmed through serological testing) was
included. At the time of sampling, control individuals
did not exhibit any symptoms suggestive of COVID-19.
The ethics committees of the participating hospital cent-
ers approved the study protocol. Informed consent was
obtained from all participants before their inclusion
in the study. All data collected were treated with strict
confidentiality and adhered to relevant data protection
regulations.

DNA extraction

DNA isolation from peripheral blood from all patients
was performed using automatic equipment and a com-
mercial kit based on magnetic beads separation. Total
genomic DNA quantification was carried out using an
N60 Implen Nanophotometer. Samples showing aber-
rant protein (260/280) and organic compounds (230/260)
ratios were discarded or purified.

Methylation assay

Following the manufacturer’s instructions, 900 ng of
high-quality genomic DNA was bisulfite converted using
the EZ DNA methylation kit (D5001, Zymo Research
Corporation). Illumina incubation conditions were
used to increase the efficiency and reproducibility of
the bisulfite conversion. Quality control/quantification
of bisulfite-converted DNA (bsDNA) was performed
using an N60 Implen Nanophotometer. Approximately
200 ng/ul of bisulfite-converted DNA was hybridized
on Illumina Infinium Methylation EPIC BeadChips.
Fluorescent signals were detected using the (two-color
laser—532 nm/660 nm) Illumina iScan scanner and
saved as intensity data files (*.idat). The methylation
level for each CpG site is represented as B-values based
on the fluorescent intensity ratio between methylated
and unmethylated probes. 6-values may range between 0
(non-methylated) and 1 (completely methylated).

Quality control and differential methylation analysis
The generation of the f-value dataset of all samples was
carried out using the ChAMP package [95]: After the

--- Page 12 ---
Calzari et al. Clinical Epigenetics (2024) 16:112

quality control/preprocessing step, 12,777 probes with
a detection p-value above 0.01, 5179 probes with a bead
count <3 in at least 5% of samples, 2875 NoCG probes,
94,318 probes with potential SNPs [96], 11 probes that
align to multiple locations, and 16,424 probes located on
X and Y chromosomes were filtered out. 734,334 probes
and 287 samples were retained. After BMIQ normaliza-
tion, the variability due to the batch effect was corrected
by using the ComBat function [97], which performs para-
metric empirical Bayesian adjustments. To infer the pro-
portions of a priori known cell types (e.g., CD8+T and
CD4+T-cells, natural killer (NK) cells, B cells, mono-
cytes, granulocytes (basophils, eosinophils, and neu-
trophils)) present in blood samples, we used EpiDISH
package [40] in R environment.

Differential methylation analysis at the CpG sites level
was conducted at the group level by computing p-val-
ues using the “Limma’” package [41]. At the region level
(Genes, promoters, CpG island, tiling), the “RnBeads”
differential methylation (Limma) module was alterna-
tively used [98].

To adjust for potential confounding factors, a principal
component analysis (PCA) was performed to evaluate the
association of age and blood cell estimations with both
dependent (disease groups) and independent (methyla-
tion values) variables: The principal components summa-
rizing 80% of the variability were used as covariates in the
differential methylation step. Principal components (PCs)
were used to avoid collinearity of covariates. Estimation
of biological age (Horvath, Hannum, PhenoAge, DNAm
skin, and blood) [43-45] and telomere length (surrogate
marker DNAmTL) [46] were assessed using the DNA
methylation age calculator analysis tool [42] (https://
dnamage.genetics.ucla.edu/). Enrichment analysis on
differentially methylated sites was performed using the
"methylGSA" package [99] (methylglm function) in the R
environment.

Individual sample analyses were carried out by
identifying stochastic epigenetic mutations (SEMs)
as described in [3, 47-51]. SEMs represent extreme
aberrant methylation data points and were identi-
fied for each CpG site by comparing the methyla-
tion profile of each case to a reference methylation
range, calculated from a control population as fol-
lows: upper value= Q3+(k * IQR), lower value= Q1—
(k * IQR), where Q1 represents the first quartile, Q3
corresponds to the third quartile, IQR (Interquartile
Range) equals Q3—QI1, and k is set at 3. Outlier val-
ues were then classified as hyper-methylated or hypo-
methylated with respect to the median values of the
controls’ corresponding probes. Gene annotation of
SEMs was obtained using the web tool wWANNOVAR
[100]. For testing associations between cases and SEM

Page 12 of 15

enriched genes, a method for rare variants analysis was
applied using the SCAT-O method implemented in the
RVTESTS package [52]. Organization/investigation of
results was conducted according to the clinical charac-
teristics/keywords by using the available prioritization
tools, including WEB-based gene set analysis toolkit
(WebGestalt) [101] which uses, among others, gene
ontology, KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and
Genomes) and PANTHER (protein analysis through
evolutionary relationships) databases, and VarElect (the
next-generation sequencing phenotyper) [102]. Data/
results were visualized using the "ggplot2" package for
PCA charts and boxplots, the "Pheatmap" package for
the heatmaps, and the "CMplot" for the Manhattan
plots. Linear regressions (after checking assumptions)
or the Mann-Whitney function were used to evaluate
statistical differences in age, cell-type composition, and
burden of SEMs between cases and controls. Unless
otherwise stated, the statistical significance threshold
was set to 0.05.

Meta-analysis The meta-analysis was performed
using the computational tool METAL [103], specifically
designed for (epi) genome-wide analysis. Only the over-
lapping site-specific p-values (1 = 723,656) derived from
the differential methylation analyses were integrated into
the meta-analysis.

Long COVID: major findings,
mechanisms and recommendations

Abstract

Sections

Long COVID is an often debilitating illness that occurs in at least 10%

of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
infections. More than 200 symptoms have been identified with impacts
on multiple organ systems. At least 65 million individuals worldwide are
estimated to have long COVID, with cases increasing daily. Biomedical
research has made substantial progress in identifying various
pathophysiological changes and risk factors and in characterizing

the illness; further, similarities with other viral-onset illnesses such as
myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome and postural
orthostatic tachycardia syndrome have laid the groundwork for
research in the field. In this Review, we explore the current literature
and highlight key findings, the overlap with other conditions, the
variable onset of symptoms, long COVID in children and the impact of
vaccinations. Although these key findings are critical to understanding
long COVID, current diagnostic and treatment options are insufficient,
and clinical trials must be prioritized that address leading hypotheses.
Additionally, to strengthen long COVID research, future studies must
account for biases and SARS-CoV-2 testing issues, build on viral-onset
research, be inclusive of marginalized populations and meaningfully
engage patients throughout the research process.

isa multisystemic condition comprising often severe symptoms that
follow asevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
infection. At least 65 million individuals around the world have long
COVID, based onaconservative estimated incidence of 10% of infected
people and more than 651 million documented COVID-19 cases world-
wide’; the number is likely much higher due to many undocumented
cases. The incidence is estimated at 10-30% of non-hospitalized cases,
50-70% of hospitalized cases** and 10-12% of vaccinated cases**. Long
COVID is associated with all ages and acute phase disease severities,
with the highest percentage of diagnoses between the ages of 36 and
50 years, and most long COVID cases are in non-hospitalized patients
witha mild acute illness®, as this population represents the majority
of overall COVID-19 cases. There are many research challenges, as out-
lined in this Review, and many open questions, particularly relating to
pathophysiology, effective treatments and risk factors.

Hundreds of biomedical findings have been documented, with
many patients experiencing dozens of symptoms across multiple organ
systems’ (Fig. 1). Long COVID encompasses multiple adverse outcomes,
with common new-onset conditions including cardiovascular, throm-
boticand cerebrovascular disease®, type 2 diabetes’, myalgic encepha-
lomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) and dysautonomia,
especially postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS)” (Fig. 2).
Symptoms can last for years”, and particularly in cases of new-onset
ME/CFS and dysautonomia are expected to be lifelong”. With signifi-
cant proportions of individuals with long COVID unable to return to
work’, the scale of newly disabled individuals is contributing to labour
shortages”. There are currently no validated effective treatments.

There are likely multiple, potentially overlapping, causes of long
COVID. Several hypotheses for its pathogenesis have been suggested,
including persisting reservoirs of SARS-CoV-2 in tissues’; immune
dysregulation’”~° with or without reactivation of underlying patho-
gens, including herpesviruses such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and
human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) among others’”"*!*; impacts of SARS-
CoV-2 on the microbiota, including the virome’””>**; autoimmun-
ity’””°*5 and priming of the immune system from molecular mimicry”;
microvascular blood clotting with endothelial dysfunction”; and
dysfunctional signalling in the brainstem and/or vagus nerve’ (Fig. 3).
Mechanistic studies are generally at an early stage, and although work
that builds on existing research from postviral illnesses such as ME/CFS
has advanced some theories, many questions remain and area priority
to address. Risk factors potentially include female sex, type 2 diabetes,
EBV reactivation, the presence of specific autoantibodies”, connective
tissue disorders”, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, chronic
urticaria and allergic rhinitis”, although a third of people with long
COVID have no identified pre-existing conditions’. A higher prevalence
of long Covid has been reported in certain ethnicities, including people
with Hispanic or Latino heritage®. Socio-economic risk factors include
lower income and an inability to adequately rest in the early weeks after
developing COVID-19 (refs. *°*”). Before the emergence of SARS-CoV-2,
multiple viral and bacterial infections were known to cause postinfec-
tious illnesses such as ME/CFS””*’, and there are indications that long
COVID shares their mechanistic and phenotypic characteristics”.
Further, dysautonomia has been observed in other postviral illnesses
and is frequently observed inlong COVID’.

In this Review, we explore the current knowledge base of long
COVID as well as misconceptions surrounding long COVID and areas
where additional research is needed. Because most patients with long

COVID were not hospitalized for their initial SARS-CoV-2 infection’,
we focus on research that includes patients with mild acute COVID-19
(meaning not hospitalized and without evidence of respiratory disease).
Most of the studies we discuss refer to adults, except for those in Box 1.

Major findings

Immunology and virology

Studies looking at immune dysregulation in individuals with long
COVID who had mild acute COVID-19 have found T cell alterations,
including exhausted T cells’, reduced CD4* and CD8* effector memory
cell numbers’ and elevated PD1 expression oncentral memory cells,
persisting for at least 13 months”. Studies have also reported highly
activated innate immune cells, alack of naive T and B cells and elevated
expression of type 1 and type Ill interferons (interferon-B (IFNB) and
IFNA1), persisting for at least 8 months”°. A comprehensive study
comparing patients with long COVID with uninfected individuals and
infected individuals without long COVID found increases in the num-
bers of non-classical monocytes, activated B cells, double-negative
Bcells, and IL-4- and IL-6-secreting CD4* T cells and decreases in the
numbers of conventional dendritic cells and exhausted T cells and
low cortisol levels in individuals with long COVID at a median of
14 months after infection’’. The expansion of cytotoxic T cells has been
found to be associated with the gastrointestinal presentation of long
COVID”. Additional studies have found elevated levels of cytokines,
particularly IL-1, IL-6, TNF and IP10 (refs. *°“'), anda recent preprint has
reported persistent elevation of the level of CCL11, which is associated
with cognitive dysfunction’. It remains to be seen whether the pat-
tern of cytokines in ME/CFS, where the levels of certain cytokines are
elevated in the first 2-3 years of illness but decrease over time without
a corresponding decrease in symptoms”, is similar in long COVID.

Multiple studies have found elevated levels of autoantibodies in
long COVID”, including autoantibodies to ACE2 (ref. **) (the receptor
for SARS-CoV-2 entry), B,-adrenoceptor, muscarinic M2 receptor,
angiotensin II AT, receptor and the angiotensin 1-7 MAS receptor’’.
High levels of other autoantibodies have been found insome patients
with COVID-19 more generally, including autoantibodies that target the
tissue (suchas connective tissue, extracellular matrix components, vas-
cular endothelium, coagulation factors and platelets), organ systems
(including the lung, central nervous system, skin and gastrointestinal
tract), immunomodulatory proteins (cytokines, chemokines, comple-
ment components and cell-surface proteins)**. A major comprehensive
study, however, did not find autoantibodies to bea major component
of long COVID*.

Reactivated viruses, including EBV and HHV-6, have been foundin
patients with long COVID'*”*”’ (and have been identified in ME/CFS*),
and lead to mitochondrial fragmentation and severely affect energy
metabolism**. A recent preprint has reported that EBV reactivation
is associated with fatigue and neurocognitive dysfunction in patients
with long COVID”.

Several studies have shown low or no SARS-CoV-2 antibody
production and other insufficient immune responses in the acute
stage of COVID-19 to be predictive of long COVID at 6-7 months, in
both hospitalized patients and non-hospitalized patients*”**. These
insufficient immune responses include a low baseline level of IgG**,
low levels of receptor-binding domain and spike-specific memory
Bcells, lowlevels of nucleocapsid IgG*’ and low peaks of spike-specific
IgG’. Ina recent preprint, low or absent CD4* T cell and CD8° T cell
responses were noted in patients with severe long COVID*’, and
aseparate study found lower levels of CD8’ T cells expressing CD107a

and a decline in nucleocapsid-specific interferon-y-producing CD8*
T cells in patients with long COVID compared with infected controls
without long COVID™. High levels of autoantibodies in long COVID
have been found to be inversely correlated with protective COVID-19
antibodies, suggesting that patients with high autoantibody levels
may be morelikely to have breakthrough infections”. SARS-CoV-2 viral
rebound in the gut, possibly resulting from viral persistence, has also
been associated with lower levels and slower production of receptor-
binding domain IgA and IgG antibodies”. There are major differences
inantibody creation, seroreversion and antibody titre levels across the
sexes, with women being less likely to seroconvert, being more likely to
serorevert and having lower antibody levels overall’, even affecting
antibody waning after vaccination™.

Several reports have pointed towards possible viral persistence as
a driver of long COVID symptoms; viral proteins and/or RNA has been
found inthe reproductive system, cardiovascular system, brain, mus-
cles, eyes, lymph nodes, appendix, breast tissue, hepatic tissue, lung
tissue, plasma, stool andurine*°. In one study, circulating SARS-CoV-2
spike antigen was found in 60% of a cohort of 37 patients with long
COVID up to 12 months after diagnosis compared with 0% of 26 SARS-
CoV-2-infected individuals, likely implying a reservoir of active virus
or components of the virus’. Indeed, multiple reports following gas-
trointestinal biopsies have indicated the presence of virus, suggestive
ofa persistent reservoir in some patients”.

Vascular issues and organ damage

Although COVID-19 was initially recognized as a respiratory illness,
SARS-CoV-2 has capability to damage many organ systems. The damage
that has been demonstrated across diverse tissues has predominantly
been attributed to immune-mediated response and inflammation,
rather than direct infection of cells by the virus. Circulatory system
disruption includes endothelial dysfunction and subsequent down-
stream effects, and increased risks of deep vein thrombosis, pulmo-
nary embolism and bleeding events”*”*. Microclots detected in both
acute COVID-19 and long COVID contribute to thrombosis and are an
attractive diagnostic and therapeutic target. Long-term changes to the
size and stiffness of blood cells have also been found in long COVID,
with the potential to affect oxygen delivery. A long-lasting reduction
in vascular density, specifically affecting small capillaries, was found in
patients with long COVID compared with controls, 18 months after
infection®. A study finding elevated levels of vascular transforma-
tion blood biomarkers in long COVID also found that the angiogenesis
markers ANG1and P-selectin both had high sensitivity and specificity
for predicting long COVID status”.

An analysis of the US Department of Veterans Affairs databases
(VA data) including more than 150,000 individuals 1 year after SARS-
CoV-2 infection indicated a significantly increased risk of a variety of
cardiovascular diseases, including heart failure, dysrhythmias and
stroke, independent of the severity of initial COVID-19 presentation®
(Fig. 2). Cardiac MRI studies revealed cardiac impairment in 78% of
100 individuals who had a prior COVID-19 episode (investigated an
average of 71 days after infection”) and in 58% of participants with long
COVID (studied 12 months after infection®), reinforcing the durability
of cardiac abnormalities.

Multiple studies have revealed multi-organ damage associated
with COVID-19. One prospective study of low-risk individuals, looking
at the heart, lungs, liver, kidneys, pancreas and spleen, noted that 70%
of 201 patients had damage to at least one organ and 29% had multi-
organ damage”. In a 1-year follow-up study, conducted by the same

individuals who had COVID-19, found that infection also increases
the risk of type 2 diabetes’ (Fig. 2). The organ damage experienced

Fig. 2| SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19 and long COVID increases the risk
ofseveral medical conditions. Because diagnosis-specific data on large
populations with long COVID are sparse, outcomes from general infections are
included and a large proportion of medical conditions are expected to result
from long COVID, although the precise proportion cannot be determined. One
year after the initial infection, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2) infections increased the risk of cardiac arrest, death, diabetes, heart
failure, pulmonary embolism and stroke, as studied with use of US Department
of Veterans Affairs databases. Additionally, there is clear increased risk of
developing myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS)

and dysautonomia. Six months after breakthrough infection, increased risks
were observed for cardiovascular conditions, coagulation and haematological
conditions, death, fatigue, neurological conditions and pulmonary conditions in
the same cohort. The hazard ratio is the ratio of how often an event occurs in one
group relative to another; in this case people who have had COVID-19 compared
with those who have not. Data sources are as follows: diabetes’, cardiovascular
outcomes’, dysautonomia’”””, ME/CFS°””” and breakthrough infections‘.

by patients with long COVID appears durable, and long-term effects
remain unknown.

Neurological and cognitive systems
Neurological and cognitive symptoms are a major feature of long
COVID, including sensorimotor symptoms, memory loss, cognitive
impairment, paresthesia, dizziness and balance issues, sensitivity to
light and noise, loss of (or phantom) smell or taste, and autonomic
dysfunction, often impacting activities of daily living’”. Audioves-
tibular manifestations of long COVID include tinnitus, hearing loss
and vertigo”.

Ina meta-analysis, fatigue was found in 32% and cognitive impair-
ment was found in 22% of patients with COVID-19 at 12 weeks after

infection’. Cognitive impairments in long COVIDare debilitating, at the
same magnitude as intoxication at the UK drink driving limit or 10 years
of cognitive ageing”, and may increase over time, with one study find-
ing occurrence in 16% of patients at 2 months after infection and 26%
of patients at 12 months after infection”. Activation of the kynure-
nine pathway, particularly the presence of the metabolites quinolinic
acid, 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid and kynurenine, has been identified in
long COVID, and is associated with cognitive impairment”. Cognitive
impairment has also been found in individuals who recovered from
COVID-19 (ref. ’°), and at higher rates when objective versus subjective
measures were used’, suggesting that a subset of those with cognitive
impairment may not recognize and/or report their impairment. Cogni-
tive impairmentisa feature that manifests itself independently of men-
tal health conditions suchas anxiety and depression”, and occurs at
similar rates in hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients”. A report
of more than 1.3 million people who had COVID-19 showed mental
health conditions such as anxiety and depression returned to normal
over time, but increased risks of cognitive impairment (brain fog),
seizures, dementia, psychosis and other neurocognitive conditions
persisted for at least 2 years”.

Possible mechanisms for these neuropathologies include neuro-
inflammation, damage to blood vessels by coagulopathy and endothe-
lial dysfunction, and injury to neurons”. Studies have found Alzheimer
disease-like signalling in patients with long COVID”, peptides that
self-assemble into amyloid clumps which are toxic to neurons”, wide-
spread neuroinflammation®, brain and brainstem hypometabolism
correlated with specific symptoms*” and abnormal cerebrospinal fluid
findings in non-hospitalized individuals with long COVID along with an
association between younger age and a delayed onset of neurological
symptoms*™. Multilineage cellular dysregulation and myelin loss were
reported inarecent preprint in patients with long COVID who had mild
infections, with microglial reactivity similar to that seen in chemother-
apy, knownas ‘chemo-brain’”. A study from the UK Biobank, including
brain imaging in the same patients before and after COVID-19 as well
as control individuals, showed a reduction in grey matter thickness in
the orbitofrontal cortex and parahippocampal gyrus (markers of tissue
damage in areas connected tothe primary olfactory cortex), an overall
reduction in brain size and greater cognitive decline in patients after
COVID-19 compared with controls, even in non-hospitalized patients.
Although that study looked at individuals with COVID-19 compared with
controls, not specifically long COVID, it may have an implication for the
cognitive component of long COVID™. Abnormal levels of mitochon-
drial proteins as well as SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleocapsid proteins
have been found in the central nervous system®. Tetrahydrobiopterin
deficiencies and oxidative stress are found in long COVID as well®®.

In the eyes, corneal small nerve fibre loss and increased den-
dritic cell density have been found in long COVID*”**, as well as
significantly altered pupillary light responses® and impaired retinal
microcirculation’’. SARS-CoV-2 can infect and replicate in retinal” and
brain” organoids. Other manifestations of long COVID include retinal
haemorrhages, cotton wool spots and retinal vein occlusion”.

Mouse models of mild SARS-CoV-2 infection demonstrated micro-
glial reactivity and elevated levels of CCL11, which is associated with
cognitive dysfunction and impaired neurogenesis*”. Hamster models
exhibited an ongoing inflammatory state, involving T cell and myeloid
activation, production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and an inter-
feron response that was correlated with anxiety and depression-like
behaviours in the hamsters, with similar transcriptional signatures
found inthe tissue of humans who had recovered from COVID-19 (ref. ).

Infected non-human primates with mild illness showed neuroinflam-
mation, neuronal injury and apoptosis, brain microhaemorrhages, and
chronic hypoxaemia and brain hypoxia”.

Recent reports indicate low blood cortisol levels in patients with
long COVID as compared with control individuals, more than 1 year
into symptom duration'*”’”. Low cortisol production by the adrenal
gland should be compensated by an increase in adrenocorticotropic
hormone (ACTH) production by the pituitary gland, but this was not
the case, supporting hypothalamus-pituitary—adrenal axis dysfunc-
tion’’. This may also reflect an underlying neuroinflammatory process.
Low cortisol levels have previously been documented in individuals
with ME/CFS.

ME/CFS, dysautonomia and related conditions
ME/CFS is a multisystem neuroimmune illness with onset often fol-
lowing a viral or bacterial infection. Criteria include a “substantial
reduction or impairment in the ability to engage in pre-illness levels
of occupational, educational, social, or personal activities” for at least
6 months, accompanied by a profound fatigue that is not alleviated by
rest, along with postexertional malaise, unrefreshing sleep and cogni-
tive impairment or orthostatic intolerance (or both)”*. Up to 75% of
people with ME/CFS cannot work full-time and 25% have severe ME/CFS,
which often means they are bed-bound, have extreme sensitivity to
sensory input and are dependent on others for care’®. There is a vast
collection of biomedical findings in ME/CFS”””’, although these are not
well known to researchers and clinicians in other fields.
Manyresearchershavecommentedonthesimilaritybetween ME/CFS
and long COVID”; around half of individuals with long COVID are
estimated to meet the criteria for ME/CFS"? and in studies where
the cardinal ME/CFS symptom of postexertional malaise is measured,
amajority of individuals with long COVID report experiencing postex-
ertional malaise”’°°. A study of orthostatic stress in individuals with
long COVID and individuals with ME/CFS found similar haemodynamic,

symptomatic and cognitive abnormalities in both groups compared
with healthy individuals’. Importantly, it is not surprising that
ME/CFS should stem from SARS-CoV-2 infection as 27.1% of SARS-CoV
infection survivors in one study met the criteria for ME/CFS diagnosis
4 years after onset’. A wide range of pathogens cause ME/CFS onset,
including EBV, Coxiella burnetii (which causes Q fever), Ross River virus
and West Nile virus®*.

Consistent abnormal findings in ME/CFS include diminished natu-
ral killer cell function, T cell exhaustion and other T cell abnormalities,
mitochondrial dysfunction, and vascular and endothelial abnormali-
ties, including deformed red blood cells and reduced blood volume.
Other abnormalities include exercise intolerance, impaired oxygen con-
sumption anda reduced anaerobic threshold, and abnormal metabolic
profiles, including altered usage of fatty acids and amino acids. Altered
neurological functions have also been observed, including neuro-
inflammation, reduced cerebral blood flow, brainstem abnormalities
and elevated ventricular lactate level, as well as abnormal eye and vision
findings. Reactivated herpesviruses (including EBV, HHV-6, HHV-7 and
human cytomegalovirus) are also associated with ME/CFS””°*!0>10%,

Many of these findings have been observed in long COVID studies
in both adults and children (Box 1). Long COVID research has found
mitochondrial dysfunction including loss of mitochondrial membrane
potential’ and possible dysfunctional mitochondrial metabolism’°’,
altered fatty acid metabolism and dysfunctional mitochondrion-
dependent lipid catabolism consistent with mitochondrial dysfunction
in exercise intolerance’”, redox imbalance!”’, and exercise intoler-
ance and impaired oxygen extraction’°°'°*""”. Studies have also found
endothelial dysfunction”, cerebral blood flow abnormalities and meta-
bolic changes*"""? (even in individuals with long COVID whose POTS
symptoms abate”), extensive neuroinflammation*”"’, reactivated her-
pesviruses'*'””, deformed red blood cells and many findings discussed
elsewhere. Microclots and hyperactivated platelets are found not only
in individuals with long COVID but also in individuals with ME/CFS".

Long COVID in children

Long COVID impacts children of all ages. One study found that
fatigue, headache, dizziness, dyspnoea, chest pain, dysosmia,
dysgeusia, reduced appetite, concentration difficulties, memory
issues, mental exhaustion, physical exhaustion and sleep issues
were more common in individuals with long COVID aged 15-19 years
compared with controls of the same age*”’. A nationwide study in
Denmark comparing children with a positive PCR test result with
control individuals found that the former had a higher chance of
reporting at least one symptom lasting more than 2 months”.
Similarly to adults with long COVID, children with long COVID
experience fatigue, postexertional malaise, cognitive dysfunction,
memory loss, headaches, orthostatic intolerance, sleep difficulty
and shortness of breath?**”°°. Liver injury has been recorded in
children who were not hospitalized during acute severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections”°°,

and although rare, children who had COVID-19 have increased risks
of acute pulmonary embolism, myocarditis and cardiomyopathy,
venous thromboembolic events, acute and unspecified renal failure,
and type 1 diabetes”. Infants born to women who had COVID-19

Dysautonomia, particularly POTS, is commonly comorbid
with ME/CFS“ and also often has a viral onset". POTS is associated with
G protein-coupled adrenergic receptor and muscarinic acetylcholine
receptor autoantibodies, platelet storage pool deficiency, small fibre
neuropathy and other neuropathologies"®. Both POTS and small
fibre neuropathy are commonly found in long COVID'"”, with one
study finding POTS in 67% of a cohort with long COVID”°.

Mast cell activation syndrome is also commonly comorbid with
ME/CFS. The number and severity of mast cell activation syndrome
symptoms substantially increased in patients with long COVID com-
pared with pre-COVID and control individuals”, with histamine receptor
antagonists resulting in improvements in the majority of patients”.

Other conditions that are commonly comorbid with ME/CFS
include connective tissue disorders including Ehlers-Danlos syndrome
and hypermobility, neuro-orthopaedic spinal and skull conditions, and
endometriosis**’*"”’. Evidence is indicating these conditions may be
comorbid with long COVID as well. The overlap of postviral conditions
with these conditions should be explored further.

Reproductive system

Impacts on the reproductive system are often reported in long COVID,
although little research has been done to document the extent of
the impact and sex-specific pathophysiology. Menstrual alterations
are more likely to occur in women and people who menstruate with
long COVID thanin womenand people who menstruate with no history of
COVID and those who had COVID-19 but not long COVID™*. Menstruation
and the week before menstruation have been identified by patients as
triggers for relapses of long COVID symptoms’. Declined ovarian reserve
and reproductive endocrine disorder have been observed in people with
COVID-19 (ref. ”°), and initial theories suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection
affects ovary hormone production and/or the endometrial response

during pregnancy were more likely to receive a neurodevelopmental
diagnosis in the first year after delivery”™. A paediatric long COVID
centre's experience treating patients suggests that adolescents with a
moderate to severe form of long COVID have features consistent with
myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome”. Children
experiencing long COVID have hypometabolism in the brain similar to
the patterns found in adults with long COVID”°. Long-term pulmonary
dysfunction is found in children with long COVID and those who
have recovered from COVID-19 (ref. “°). Children with long COVID
were more likely to have had attention deficit hyperactivity disorder,
chronic urticaria and allergic rhinitis before being infected™.

More research on long COVID in children is needed, although there
are difficulties in ensuring a proper control group due to testing issues.
Several studies have found that children infected with SARS-CoV-2 are
considerably less likely to have a positive PCR test result than adults
despite seroconverting weeks later, with up to 90% of cases being
missed'*°"°°. Additionally, children are much less likely to seroconvert
and, if they develop antibodies, are more likely to have a waning

response months after infection compared with adults’.

due to the abundance of ACE2 receptors on ovarian and endometrial
tissue’. Individuals with both COVID-19 and menstrual changes were
more likely to experience fatigue, headache, body ache and pain, and
shortness of breath than those who did not have menstrual changes,
and the most common menstrual changes were irregular menstruation,
increased premenstrual symptoms and infrequent menstruation”.

Research on ME/CFS shows associations between ME/CFS and
premenstrual dysphoric disorder, polycystic ovarian syndrome, men-
strual cycle abnormalities, ovarian cysts, early menopause and endo-
metriosis’*°. Pregnancy, postpartum changes, perimenopause and
menstrual cycle fluctuations affect ME/CFS and influence metabolic
andimmune system changes”’. Long COVID research should focus on
these relationships to better understand the pathophysiology.

Viral persistence in the penile tissue has been documented, as
has an increased risk of erectile dysfunction, likely resulting from
endothelial dysfunction’. In one study, impairments to sperm count,
semen volume, motility, sperm morphology and sperm concentration
were reported in individuals with long COVID compared with control
individuals, and were correlated with elevated levels of cytokines and
the presence of caspase 8, caspase 9 and caspase 3 in seminal fluid’.

Respiratory system

Respiratory conditions area common phenotype inlong COVID, andin
one study occurred twice as often in COVID-19 survivors as in the gen-
eral population’. Shortness of breath and cough are the most common
respiratory symptoms, and persisted for at least 7 months in 40% and
20% of patients with long COVID, respectively’. Several imaging studies
that included non-hospitalized individuals with long COVID demon-
strated pulmonary abnormalities including in air trapping and lung
perfusion’***. An immunological and proteomic study of patients
3-6 months after infection indicated apoptosis and epithelial damage in

the airway but not in blood samples». Further immunological charac-
terization comparing individuals with long COVID with individuals who
had recovered from COVID-19 noted a correlation between decreased
lung function, systemic inflammation and SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells’**.

Gastrointestinal system

Long COVID gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, abdominal
pain, loss of appetite, heartburn and constipation’. The gut microbiota
composition is significantly altered in patients with COVID-19 (ref.*’),
and gut microbiota dysbiosis is also a key component of ME/CFS".
Higher levels of Ruminococcus gnavus and Bacteroides vulgatus and
lower levels of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii have been found in people
with long COVID compared with non-COVID-19 controls (from before
the pandemic), with gut dysbiosis lasting at least 14 months; low levels
of butyrate-producing bacteria are strongly correlated with long COVID
at 6 months™. Persisting respiratory and neurological symptoms are
each associated with specific gut pathogens”. Additionally, SARS-CoV-2
RNAis present in stool samples of patients with COVID-19 (ref.’), with
one study indicating persistence in the faeces of 12.7% of participants
4 months after diagnosis of COVID-19 and in 3.8% of participants at
7 months after diagnosis”. Most patients with long COVID symptoms
and inflammatory bowel disease 7 months after infection had antigen
persistence in the gut mucosa™”. Higher levels of fungal translocation,
from the gut and/or lung epithelium, have been found in the plasma
of patients with long COVID compared with those without long COVID
or SARS-CoV-2-negative controls, possibly inducing cytokine produc-
tion’. Transferring gut bacteria from patients with long COVID to
healthy mice resulted in lost cognitive functioning and impaired lung
defences in the mice, who were partially treated with the commensal
probiotic bacterium Bifidobacterium longum”.

Timelines

The onset and time course of symptoms differ across individuals and
by symptom type. Neurological symptoms often havea delayed onset
of weeks to months: among participants with cognitive symptoms,
43% reported a delayed onset of cognitive symptoms at least 1 month
after COVID-19, with the delay associated with younger age*’. Several
neurocognitive symptoms worsen over time and tend to persist longer,
whereas gastrointestinal and respiratory symptoms are more likely to
resolve’”*?, Additionally, pain injoints, bones, ears, neck and back are
more common at 1 year than at 2 months, as is paresthesia, hair loss,
blurry vision and swelling of the legs, hands and feet'**. Parosmia has
an average onset of 3 months after the initial infection“; unlike other
neurocognitive symptoms, it often decreases over time’.

Few people with long COVID demonstrate full recovery, with one
study finding that 85% of patients who had symptoms 2 months after
the initial infection reported symptoms 1 year after symptom onset’.
Future prognosis is uncertain, although diagnoses of ME/CFS and
dysautonomia are generally lifelong.

Diagnostic tools and treatments

Although diagnostic tools exist for some components of long COVID
(for example, tilt table tests for POTS’ and MRI scans to detect car-
diovascular impairment“), diagnostic tools for long COVID are mostly
in development, including imaging to detect microclots”, corneal
microscopy to identify small fibre neuropathy”, new fragmentation of
QRS complex on electrocardiograms as indicative of cardiac injury'*°
and use of hyperpolarized MRI to detect pulmonary gas exchange
abnormalities”. On the basis of the tests that are offered as standard

care, the results for patients with long COVID are often normal; many
providers are unaware of the symptom-specific testing and diagnos-
tic recommendations from the ME/CFS community“. Early research
into biomarkers suggests that levels of extracellular vesicles® and/or
immune markers indicating high cytotoxicity” could be indicative
of long COVID. Intriguingly, dogs can identify individuals with long
COVID on the basis of sweat samples'*°. Biomarker research in ME/CFS
may also be applicable to long COVID, including electrical impedance
blood tests, saliva tests, erythrocyte deformation, sex-specific plasma
lipid profiles and variables related to isocapnic buffering’ '**. The
importance of developing and validating biomarkers that can be used
for the diagnosis of long COVID cannot be adequately emphasized —
they will not only be helpful in establishing the diagnosis but will also
be helpful for objectively defining treatment responses.

Although there are currently no broadly effective treatments for
long COVID, treatments for certain components have been effective
for subsets of populations (Table 1). Many strategies for ME/CFS are
effective for individuals with long COVID, including pacing” and symp-
tom-specific pharmacological options (for example, B-blockers for
POTS, low-dose naltrexone for neuroinflammation’” and intravenous
immunoglobulin for immune dysfunction) and non-pharmacological
options (including increasing salt intake for POTS, cognitive pacing for
cognitive dysfunction and elimination diets for gastrointestinal symp-
toms)*’. Low-dose naltrexone has been used in many diseases, including
ME/CFS'®, and has also shown promise in treating long COVID'*°. H, and
H, antihistamines, often following protocols for mast cell activation
syndrome and particularly involving famotidine, are used to alleviate a
wide range of symptoms”, although they are nota cure. Another drug,
BCO07, potentially addresses autoimmunity by neutralizing G protein-
coupled receptor autoantibody levels'*. Anticoagulant regimens area
promising way to address abnormal clotting’”; in one study, resolution
of symptoms was seen in all 24 patients receiving triple anticoagulant
therapy™. Apheresis has also shown promise to alleviate long COVID
symptoms; it has been theorized to help remove microclots'°° and
has been shown to reduce autoantibodies in ME/CFS”. However, it
is quite expensive, and its benefits are uncertain. Some supplements
have shown promise in treating both long COVID and ME/CFS, including
coenzyme Q,, and D-ribose’”, and may deserve further study.

Of note, exercise is harmful for patients with long COVID who
have ME/CFS or postexertional malaise"'® and should not be used
as a treatment''°°; one study of people with long COVID noted that
physical activity worsened the condition of 75% of patients, and less
than 1% saw improvement’.

Pilot studies and case reports have revealed additional treat-
ment options worth exploring. A case report noted resolution of long
COVID following treatment with the antiviral Paxlovid’”, and a study
investigating the treatment of acute COVID-19 with Paxlovid showed
a 25% reduction in the incidence of long COVID'**; Paxlovid should be
investigated further for prevention and treatment of long COVID. A

oxidative stress) and quality of life (indicated by higher Karnofsky
Performance Scale Index scores)'”*', as hypothesized on the basis of
success in other clinical studies.

Taken together, the current treatment options are based on
small-scale pilot studies in long COVID or what has been effective
in other diseases; several additional trials are in progress’”. There is
a wide range of possible treatment options from ME/CFS covering
various mechanisms, including improving natural killer cell func-
tion, removing autoantibodies, immunosuppressants, antivirals for
reactivated herpesviruses, antioxidants, mitochondrial support and
mitochondrial energy generation’”*’”; most need to be clinically tri-
alled, which should happen urgently. Many newer treatment options
remain underexplored, including anticoagulants and SARS-CoV-
2-specific antivirals, and a lack of funding is a significant limitation
to robust trials.

Impact of vaccines, variants and reinfections
The impact of vaccination on the incidence of long COVID differs across
studies, in part because of differing study methods, time since vaccina-
tion and definitions of long COVID. One study indicated no significant
difference in the development of long COVID between vaccinated indi-
viduals and unvaccinated individuals”; other studies indicate that
vaccines provide partial protection, with a reduced risk oflong COVID
between 15% and 41%*°, with long COVID continuing to impact 9% of
people with COVID-19.

The different SARS-CoV-2 variants and level of (and time since) vac-
cination may impact the development of long COVID. The UK’s Office
for National Statistics found that long COVID was 50% less commonin

Nature Reviews Microbiology | Volume 21| March 2023 | 133-146

Review article

double-vaccinated participants with Omicron BA.1 than in double-vac-
cinated participants Delta, but that there was no significant difference
between triple-vaccinated participants; it also found long COVID was
more common after Omicron BA.2 infection than after BA.linfection
in triple-vaccinated participants, with 9.3% developing long COVID
from infection with the BA.2 variant’”.

The impact of vaccination onlong COVID symptoms in people who
had already developed long COVID differs among patients, with 16.7%
of patients experiencing a relief of symptoms, 21.4% experiencing a
worsening of symptoms and the remainder experiencing unchanged
symptoms’.

Reinfections are increasingly common". The impact of multiple
instances of COVID-19, including the rate of long COVID in those who
recovered from a first infection but developed long COVID following
reinfection, and the impact of reinfection on those with pre-existing
long COVID is crucial to understand to inform future policy deci-
sions. Early research shows an increasing risk of long COVID sequelae
after the second and third infection, even in double-vaccinated and
triple-vaccinated people’. Existing literature suggests multiple infec-
tions may cause additional harm or susceptibility to the ME/CFS-type
presentation.

There is also early evidence that certain immune responses in
people with long COVID, including low levels of protective antibod-
ies and elevated levels of autoantibodies, may suggest an increased
susceptibility to reinfection”.

Challenges and recommendations

Issues with PCR and antibody testing throughout the pandemic, inac-
curate pandemic narratives and widespread lack of postviral knowledge
have caused downstream issues and biases in long COVID research
and care.

Testing issues

Most patients with COVID-19 from the first waves did not have labora-
tory-confirmed infection, with PCR tests being difficult to access unless
individuals were hospitalized. Only 1-3% of cases to March 2020 were
likely detected’, and the CDC estimates that only 25% of cases in the
USA were reported from February 2020 to September 2021 (ref. '*°);
that percentage has likely decreased with the rise in use of at-home
rapid tests.

Although PCR tests are our best tool for detecting SARS-CoV-2
infections, their false negative rates are still high'*°. Further bias is
caused by false negative rates being higher in women and adults
younger than 40 years’, those with a low viral load'** and children
(Box 1), with several studies showing 52-90% of cases in children missed
by PCR tests'*”’”°. The high false negative PCR rate results in sympto-
matic patients with COVID-19, who seek a COVID-19 test but receive
a false negative result, being included as a control in many studies.
Those who have a positive PCR test result (who are more likely to be
included in research) are more likely to be male or have a higher viral
load. Additionally, the lack of test accessibility as well as the false nega-
tive rates has created a significant barrier to care, as many long COVID
clinics require PCR tests for admission.

Similarly, there is a broad misconception that everyone makes and
retains SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, and many clinicians and researchers
are unaware of the limited utility of antibody tests to determine prior
infection. Between 22% and 36% of people infected with SARS-CoV-2 do
not seroconvert, and many others lose their antibodies over the first few
months, with both non-seroconversion and seroreversion being more

likely in women, children and individuals with mild infections”**"""’.
At4and 8 months after infection, 19% and 61% of patients, respectively,
who had mild infections and developed antibodies were found to have
seroreverted, compared with 2% and 29% of patients, respectively
who had severe infections’. Still, many clinicians and researchers
use antibody tests to include or exclude patients with COVID-19 from
control groups.

Furthermore, during periods of test inaccessibility, tests were
given on the basis of patients having COVID-19-specific symptoms such
as loss of smell and taste, fever, and respiratory symptoms, resulting
in a bias towards people with those symptoms.

Misinformation on PCR and antibody tests has resulted in the
categorization of patients with long COVID into non-COVID-19 control
groups, biasing the research output. Because low or no antibody levels
and viral load may be related to long COVID pathophysiology, including
aclinically diagnosed cohort will strengthen the research.

Important miscues

The narrative that COVID-19 had only respiratory sequelae led toa
delayed realization of the neurological, cardiovascular and other multi-
system impacts of COVID-19. Many long COVID clinics and providers still
disproportionately focus on respiratory rehabilitation, which results
in skewed electronic health record data. Electronic health record data
are also more comprehensive for those who were hospitalized with
COVID-19 than for those who were in community care, leading toa
bias towards the more traditional severe respiratory presentation and
less focus on non-hospitalized patients, who tend to have neurological
and/or ME/CFS-type presentations.

The narrative that initially mild COVID-19 cases, generally defined
as not requiring hospitalization in the acute phase, would not have long-
term consequences hasalso had downstream effects on research. These
so-called mild cases that result in long COVID often have an underlying
biology different from acute severe cases, but the same types of tests
are being used to evaluate patients. This is despite basic tests such as
D-dimer, C-reactive protein (CRP) and antinuclear antibody tests and
complete blood count being known to often return normal results in
patients with long COVID. Tests that return abnormal results in patients
with ME/CFS and dysautonomia, such as total immunoglobulin tests,
natural killer cell function tests, the tilt table or NASA lean test, the four-
point salivary cortisol test, reactivated herpesvirus panels, small fibre
neuropathy biopsy, and tests looking for abnormal brain perfusion’’,
should instead be prioritized. Other recurring issues include studies
failing to include the full range of symptoms, particularly neurological
and reproductive system symptoms, and not asking patients about
symptom frequency, severity and disability. Cardinal symptoms such
as postexertional malaise are not widely known, and therefore are rarely
included in study designs.

Widespread lack of postviral knowledge and misinformation

The widespread lack of knowledge of viral-onset illnesses, especially
ME/CFS and dysautonomia, as well as often imperfect coding, prevents
these conditions from being identified and documented by clinicians;
this means that they are frequently absent from electronic health record
data. Further, because ME/CFS and dysautonomia research is not widely
known or comprehensively taught in medical schools’”*, long COVID
research is often not built on past findings, and tends to repeat old
hypotheses. Additionally, long COVID research studies and medical his-
tories tend to document only the risk factors for severe acute COVID-19,
which are different from the risk factors for conditions that overlap with

Nature Reviews Microbiology | Volume 21| March 2023 | 133-146

Review article

long COVID suchas ME/CFS and dysautonomia (for example, connec-
tive tissue disorders such as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, prior illnesses
such as infectious mononucleosis and mast cell involvement)**">".

Clinicians who are not familiar with ME/CFS and dysautonomia
often misdiagnose mental health disorders in patients; four in five
patients with POTS receive a diagnosis with a psychiatric or psychologi-
cal condition before receiving a POTS diagnosis, with only 37% continu-
ing to have the psychiatric or psychological diagnosis once they have
received their POTS diagnosis'”. Researchers who are unfamiliar with
ME/CFS and dysautonomia often donot know to use specific validated
tools when conducting mental health testing, as anxiety scales often
include autonomic symptoms suchas tachycardia, and depression scales
often include symptoms such as fatigue, both of which overestimate
mental health disorder prevalence in these conditions’”"”*.

Recommendations

Although research into long COVID has been expansive and has accel-
erated, the existing research is not enough to improve outcomes for
people with long COVID. To ensure an adequate response to the long
COVID crisis, we need research that builds on existing knowledge and
is inclusive of the patient experience, training and education for the
health-care and research workforce, a public communication cam-
paign, and robust policies and funding to support research and care
inlong COVID.

Research. We need a comprehensive long COVID research agenda
that builds on the existing knowledge from ME/CFS, dysautonomia
and other viral-onset conditions, including but not limited to brain and
brainstem inflammation, appropriate neuroimaging techniques,
neuroimmunology, metabolic profiling, impaired endothelial func-
tion, mitochondrial fragmentation, antiviral and metabolic pheno-
types, hypoperfusion/cerebral blood flow, nanoneedle diagnostic
testing, overlaps with connective tissue disorders, autoimmunity
and autoantibodies, viral/microbial persistence, intracranial hyper-
tension, hypermobility, craniocervical obstructions, altered T and
B cells, metabolomics and proteomics, elevated blood lactate level,
herpesvirus reactivations, immune changes in the early versus late
postviral years, and changes to the gut microbiota. The mechanisms
of and overlaps between long COVID and connective tissue involve-
ment, mast cells and inflammatory conditions such as endometriosis
are particularly understudied and should be focused on. Because
of the high prevalence of ME/CFS, POTS and other postinfectious
illnesses in patients with long COVID, long COVID research should
include people who developed ME/CFS and other postinfectious
illnesses from a trigger other than SARS-CoV-2 in comparator groups
to improve understanding of the onset and pathophysiology of these
illnesses". Additionally, there is a known immune exhaustion process
that occurs between the second and third year of illness in ME/CFS, with
test results for cytokines being different between patients who have
been sick for shorter durations (less than 2 years) than for those who
have been sick for longer durations*’. Because of this, studies should
implement subanalyses based on the length of time participants have
been ill. Because ME/CFS and dysautonomia research is not widely
knownacross the biomedical field, long COVID research should be led
by experts from these areas to build on existing research and create
new diagnostic and imaging tools.

Robust clinical trials must bea priority moving forward as patients
currently have few treatment options. In the absence of validated treat-
ment options, patients and physicians conduct individual experiments,

which result in the duplication of efforts without generalizable knowl-
edge and pose undue risks to patients. Robust study design and
knowledge sharing must be prioritized by both funding institutions
and clinician-researchers.

It is critical that research on long COVID be representative of (or
oversample) the populations who had COVID-19 and are developing
long COVIDathigh rates, whichis disproportionately people of colour”.
Medical research has historically under-represented these populations,
and over-representation of white and socio-economically privileged
patients has been commonin long COVID research. Researchers must
work within communities of colour, LGBTQ+ communities and low-
income communities to build trust and conduct culturally competent
studies that will provide insights and treatments for long COVID for
marginalized populations.

Asasubset of patients will improve over time, and others will have
episodic symptoms, care should be taken to incorporate the possibil-
ity of alleviation of symptoms into the study design, and care should
be taken not to ascribe improvement to a particular cause without
proper modelling.

Finally, itis critical that communities of patients with long COVID
and associated conditions are meaningfully engaged in long
COVID research and clinical trials. The knowledge of those who expe-
rience an illness is crucial in identifying proper study design and key
research questions and solutions, improving the speed and direction
of research.

Training and education of the health-care and research workforce.
To prepare the next generation of health-care providers and research-
ers, medical schools must improve their education on pandemics,
viruses and infection-initiated illnesses such as long COVID and
ME/CFS, and competency evaluations should include these illnesses.
As of 2013, only 6% of medical schools fully cover ME/CFS across the
domains of treatment, research and curricula, which has created
obstacles to care, accurate diagnosis, research and treatment'*. To
ensure people with long COVID and associated conditions can receive
adequate care now, professional societies and government agencies
must educate the health-care and research workforce on these illnesses,
including the history of and current best practices for ME/CFS to not
repeat mistakes of the past, which have worsened patients’ prognoses.
The research community has madea misstep in its efforts to treat ME/
CFS'*’, and some physicians, poorly educated in the aetiology and
pathophysiology of the disorder, still advise patients to pursue harmful
interventions such as graded exercise therapy and cognitive behav-
ioural therapy, despite the injury that these interventions cause”
and the fact that they are explicitly not advised as treatments'°*"°*°°,

Public communications campaign. In addition to providing educa-
tion on long COVID to the biomedical community, we need a public
communications campaign that informs the public about the risks
and outcomes of long COVID.

Policies and funding. Finally, we need policies and funding that will
sustain long COVID research and enable people with long COVID to
receive adequate care and support. For instance, in the USA, the crea-
tion of a national institute for complex chronic conditions within the
NIH would goa long way in providing a durable funding mechanism and
arobust research agenda. Further, we need to create and fund centres
of excellence, which would provide inclusive, historically informed
and culturally competent care, as well as conduct research and provide

medical education to primary care providers. Additionally, research
and clinical care do not exist in silos. It is critical to push forward poli-
cies that address both the social determinants of health and the social

support that is needed for disabled people.

Conclusions

Long COVID is a multisystemic illness encompassing ME/CFS, dysauto-
nomia, impacts on multiple organ systems, and vascular and clotting
abnormalities. It has already debilitated millions of individuals world-
wide, and that number is continuing to grow. On the basis of more than
2 years of research on long COVID and decades of research on condi-
tions suchas ME/CFS, a significant proportion of individuals with long
COVID may have lifelong disabilities ifno action is taken. Diagnostic and
treatment options are currently insufficient, and many clinical trials
are urgently needed to rigorously test treatments that address hypoth-
esized underlying biological mechanisms, including viral persistence,

neuroinflammation, excessive blood clotting and autoimmunity.

Epigenetic modifications and glucocorticoid Ou

Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS)

Abstract

Background: Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is a debilitating idiopathic disease
characterized by unexplained fatigue that fails to resolve with sufficient rest. Diagnosis is based on a list of symptoms
and exclusion of other fatigue-related health conditions. Despite a heterogeneous patient population, immune and
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis function differences, such as enhanced negative feedback to glucocorticoids,
are recurring findings in ME/CFS studies. Epigenetic modifications, such as CoG methylation, are known to regulate
long-term phenotypic differences and previous work by our group found DNA methylome differences in ME/CFS,
however the relationship between DNA methylome modifications, clinical and functional characteristics associated
with ME/CFS has not been examined.

Methods: We examined the DNA methylome in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of a larger cohort
of female ME/CFS patients using the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip Array. In parallel to the DNA
methylome analysis, we investigated in vitro glucocorticoid sensitivity differences by stimulating PBMCs with
phytohaemagglutinin and suppressed growth with dexamethasone. We explored DNA methylation differences
using bisulfite pyrosequencing and statistical permutation. Linear regression was implemented to discover
epigenomic regions associated with self-reported quality of life and network analysis of gene ontology terms to
biologically contextualize results.

Results: We detected 12,608 differentially methylated sites between ME/CFS patients and healthy controls
predominantly localized to cellular metabolism genes, some of which were also related to self-reported quality of life
health scores. Among ME/CFS patients, glucocorticoid sensitivity was associated with differential methylation at 13 loci.

Conclusions: Our results indicate DNA methylation modifications in cellular metabolism in ME/CFS despite a
heterogeneous patient population, implicating these processes in immune and HPA axis dysfunction in ME/
CFS. Modifications to epigenetic loci associated with differences in glucocorticoid sensitivity may be important
as biomarkers for future clinical testing. Overall, these findings align with recent ME/CFS work that point towards
impairment in cellular energy production in this patient population.

Background

Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome
(ME/CFS) is an idiopathic disease characterized by pro-
found and debilitating fatigue, cognitive impairment,
unrefreshing sleep, autonomic manifestations and post-
exertional malaise [1]. Other known diseases or health
conditions that could explain the persistent presence of
fatigue, such as major depression, anorexia, and bulimia
nervosa are excluded prior to ME/CFS diagnosis. Result-
ing heterogeneity in the clinical features of ME/CFS is
an obstacle to determine its biological basis.

Many studies examining the pathophysiology of ME/CFS
have reported alterations in the hypothalamic-pituitary-
adrenal (HPA) axis. The HPA axis is a major component of
the neuroendocrine system that regulates homeostatic
processes, circadian rhythms, and environmental stress re-
sponses through a hormone cascade leading to the release
of glucocorticoids (GCs). GCs interact with the GC recep-
tor (GR) to regulate stress response and inflammation.
ME/CFS patients show mild hypocortisolism and enhanced
negative feedback response to GCs [2-4], suggesting a
major role of the HPA axis in this disease.

In addition to modified HPA axis function, alterations
in immune phenotype have been widely documented in
ME/CFS. Although the specific patterns of differences
remain unresolved, ME/CFS is associated with abnormal
cytokine profiles [5, 6], lymphocyte proportions [7-9] and
impaired immune functioning, notably decreased cytotox-
icity [10-12]. Increased inflammation in the gut micro-
biome has also been associated with ME/CFS. These
include reduced gut microbiome diversity, shifts towards
pro-inflammatory bacterial species, and a proliferation of
markers of pro-inflammatory processes in the serum [13].

Epigenetic modifications, including the methylation
of DNA at CpG dinucleotides, can influence phenotypic
changes in a long-term manner in response to external
stimuli. DNA methylation modifications in genes in-
volved in the HPA axis and the immune systems have
been strongly linked to environmental stress conditions
{14, 15]. We previously documented DNA methylome
abnormalities in peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMCs) from sudden-onset ME/CFS patients, which
were validated with bisulfite pyrosequencing [16]; these
abnormalities were significantly concentrated in genes
linked to immune regulation. Key questions remain as
whether these epigenetic modifications impact immune
cell function and their relationship to clinical features
of ME/CFS.

In the present study, we mapped loci that were epige-
netically modified in PBMCs and examined their sensi-
tivity to glucocorticoids. Our goals were to determine
how epigenetic patterns relate to HPA axis signaling in
immune cells in ME/CFS patients, and to identify neu-
roimmune pathways impacted by ME/CFS.

Methods

Subject selection criteria

A pool of 231 ME/CFS diagnosed and healthy volunteers
at 4 clinical sites in the USA was recruited by the Sol-
veCFS Biobank. ME/CFS was diagnosed based on the
Fukuda and Canadian criteria [1, 17]. Each volunteer
answered surveys about symptoms, medication use, and
medical history and completed the RAND-36 self-reported
survey [18] to assess health-related quality of life. ME/
CFS appears to be up to 1.5 times more likely to affect
females [19]. We therefore specifically selected females
for this study. From the volunteer pool, 49 ME/CFS
patients and 25 healthy controls met the following
criteria: 1) tested negative for HIV, AIDS, and/or Hepatitis
C and 2) were white non-obese females (BMI < 30) with no
prior history of immunomodulatory and/or epigenetic-

active medication consumption. The latter criterion was
aimed at minimizing potential confounding effects on the
DNA methylome and immune response.

PBMC isolation and storage

Whole blood from each volunteer was collected in so-
dium heparin tubes and shipped overnight at ambient
temperature room temperature to the Rutgers University’s
Cell and DNA Repository where they were processed.
Briefly, Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) were
isolated by Ficoll gradient centrifugation and resuspended
in 1X Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) + 1%
fetal bovine serum (FBS). Cell count estimates were ob-
tained using a ViCell XR Viability Analyzer. After counting,
approximately 10x10° PBMCs were pelletized through
centrifugation, dried and stored at -80 °C. The remaining
PBMCs were cryopreserved in 10% dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO), 50% FBS, and 40% Roswell Park Memorial In-
stitute 1640 medium (RPMI-1640), distributed in 1 ml
aliquots, and stored in liquid nitrogen. PBMC cell pel-
lets and cryopreserved PBMCs were shipped on dry ice
to the University of Toronto for subsequent analyses.

Genomic DNA extraction and purification

To obtain purified genomic DNA from the 49 ME/CFS
patients and 25 healthy controls, we used the Omega
E.Z.N.A. Tissue DNA kit following manufacturer's instruc-
tions (Omega Bio-Tek, cat. no. D3396) on a sample of
approximately 2.50x10° PBMCs from dry pellets by frac-
tioning. DNA was eluted in Tris-EDTA buffer (10 mM
Tris-CL, pH 8.5, 1 mM EDTA). We quantified its purity
and concentration using a NanoDrop 2000c Spectropho-
tometer (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Elutions
were further purified using the Qiagen MinElute Reaction
Cleanup Kit (Qiagen Canada, cat. no. 28204) when DNA
purity did not meet standard absorbance criteria, i.e., Aogo/
Aovgo = 1.8-2.0, and Ax¢o/A230 > 2.0. We diluted the purified
DNA to a final concentration of approximately 100 ng/ul.

DNA methylome arrays

We used the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450
BeadChip (450 K) array (Genome Québec core facility,
Montreal, QC) to obtain DNA methylome profiles from
ME/CFS patients (1 = 49) and healthy controls (n = 25).
Approximately 1.5 yg of purified genomic DNA from
each individual was bisulfite converted using the EZ DNA
Methylation Kit (Zymo Research) and subsequently ana-
lyzed following standard Illumina protocols for the 450 K
platform. The 450 K array interrogates the methylation
levels of more than 480 000 CpG loci, which cover 99% of
RefSeq Genes and 96% of CpG islands in the human
genome. All the 450 K raw data from this project have
been deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus
(GEO) database of the US National Center for Bio-
technology Information NCBI under the accession
number GSE93266.

DNA methylome data normalization and statistical
analyses

DNA methylome profile analysis was performed in R using
the Illumina Methylation Analyzer (IMA) package [20] and
Minfi [21]. Data from each 450 K array were annotated
according to the Human Genome Build 37 available at the
UCSC Genome Browser (http://genome.ucsc.edu/). Raw
probe florescence intensities were normalized by Subset-
quantile Within Array Normalization (SWAN) [22].
Methylation-level values for each CpG site were estimated
as beta-values. A beta value is defined as the ratio of meth-
ylated probe fluorescence intensity over total intensity
(methylated plus unmethylated probe intensities). Beta-
values range from 0 to 1 and are equivalent to the percent-
age of methylation of the CpG site [23]. DNA methylation
differences on the 450 K array are known to either be con-
founded due to genetic polymorphisms or masked due to
the large presence of invariably methylated sites in the gen-
ome [24, 25]. To optimize the number of significant DNA
methylation calls, we discarded loci that met the following
criteria: 1) the fluorescence intensity signal of the probe in
the array was statistically indistinguishable from back-
ground (detection p-value < 0.01); 2) contained SNPs, ac-
cording to dbSNP versions 132, 135, and 137, either at the
interrogated CpG locus or at the flanking single nucleotide
extension; 3) were invariable across samples with respect
to methylation (ie., mean beta-value > 0.95 or < 0.05). To
account for epigenetic variation that may arise from con-
founding factors, we corrected the beta-values for batch
effects using the ComBat algorithm [26], and included age,
Body Mass Index (BMI), and estimated cell compositions
as covariates [27]. Differentially methylated sites were
identified using the Wilcoxon-rank sum test. Benjamini-
Hochberg procedure/false discovery rate (FDR) was used
to correct for multiple testing. We considered loci as dif-
ferentially methylated, when comparing ME/CFS patients

Page 3 of 14

with healthy controls, if they met the all of the following
criteria: 1) mean beta-difference of >0.05; 2) nominal
Wilcoxon-rank sum test p-value < 0.05; and 3) FDR-
corrected p-value of < 0.05. In addition, we performed a
Pearson Chi-Squared Test in R to compare differences in
proportion of differential methylation according to genic
region and distance from a known CpG island. To further
evaluate the significance of association between methyla-
tion beta-values in each locus and dexamethasone sup-
pression assay subgroups, we performed non-parametric
permutation tests in R. To do so, we generated null distri-
butions of the mean beta-difference per locus by: 1) Ran-
domly reordering the dexamethasone suppression assay
subgroup assignments in each comparison (ie., control vs.
ME/CFS GC-Hypersensitive, control vs. ME/CFS GC-
Typical, ME/CFS GC-Hypersensitive vs. ME/CFS GC-
Typical); 2) Calculating the mean beta-difference per
probe; and 3) Repeating steps 1 and 2 10,000 times.
Approximate p-values for each randomization test were
calculated as the proportion of mean _beta-difference
values in the generated null distribution that were equal
or more extreme than the observed value for each probe.

To identify potential functions and cellular locations
of genes associated with differentially methylated loci,
we performed a Gene Ontology (GO) analysis using the
program DAVID [28, 29]. Enrichment Map [30] was
used to cluster GO terms according to the amount of
gene overlap and were textually summarized using the
WordCloud plugin.

DNA methylation validation by bisulfite pyrosequencing
We used a nested primer design to enhance amplification
of regions targeted for methylation analysis by bisulfite
pyrosequencing. First, ‘nested’ bisulfite pyrosequencing
assays for the loci of interest were designed using the Qia-
gen PyroMark Assay Design Software 2.0. Additional ‘out-
side’ primers targeting regions that encapsulated those
targeted by the PyroMark assay designs were designed
using Primer3 [31, 32]. Genomic DNA (300 ng) was bisul-
fite converted using the Zymo EZ DNA Methylation-Gold
Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. After bi-
sulfite conversion, 15 ng of bisulfite converted DNA was
subjected to PCR to obtain biotinylated products for pyro-
sequencing. Each sample was amplified with 200 uM of

Dexamethasone suppression assay and association with
DNA methylation differences

Cryopreserved PBMCs were available from ME/CFS pa-
tients (7 = 33) and healthy controls (1 = 24) that were
also examined by DNA methylome array (see above).
These cells were gently thawed in a 37 °C water bath for
5-7 min and were counted using a hemocytometer
(Thermo Fisher) and assessed for viability by Trypan
blue exclusion. After thawing, all samples had > 95% via-
bility. Based on our preliminary experiments, 4.0x10°
live PBMCs were cultured for 4 days at 37 °C, 5% COz
in RPMI-1640 + 10% fetal bovine serum [33] according
to the following treatments: 1) A control treatment with
cells and culture media only; 2) A stimulated treatment
where cells were cultured with 5 ug/ml phytohaemagglu-
tinin (PHA); and 3) a suppressed condition where cells
were cultured with 5 pg/ml PHA and 10° M dexa-
methasone. Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) was added into
each well on the 3° day of culture and cell proliferation
was assessed using the Roche BrdU colorimetric ELISA
kit. The percentage of inhibition was then calculated
using the average values of each experimental condition
with the following formula:

Stimulated—Suppressed

Inhibition % =
nhibition % Stimulated

x 100%

All assays were performed in triplicate.

We used a two-tailed t-test test to identify between-
group differences in dexamethasone response, including
subgroups of ME/CFS patient based on preliminary
observations of a binomial distribution in the patient
data. We also performed logistic regression and Pearson
correlations in R to explore if ME/CFS onset type or
RAND-36 scores were associated with differences in GC
sensitivity. Significant differentially methylated sites in
subgroups that differed in their dexamethasone suppres-
sion response were assessed according to the following
statistical criteria: 1) Mean beta-difference of > 0.05;
and 2) nominal Wilcoxon-rank sum test p-value < 0.05.

Association between clinical data and DNA methylation

Significant differentially methylated CpG sites shared
between comparisons were examined to determine sites
that were potentially related to glucocorticoid (GC) sen-
sitivity and ME/CFS. To detect significant associations
between health-related quality of life RAND-36 scores
and DNA methylome data, we performed principal com-
ponent analyses (PCA), linear regression, and FDR-
correction using the stats package in R. We restricted
this analysis to differentially methylated regions, defined
according to the 450 K annotations and having a mini-
mum of 2 sites with mean beta-difference > 0.05, to re-
duce statistical noise. Two-tailed t-tests were performed

Page 4 of 14

on demographic information and RAND-36 scores, and a
one-tailed t-test was performed on pyrosequencing data
were compared using IBM SPSS Software (Version 22).

Results

RAND-36 scores are significantly lower in ME/CFS patients
Overall, ME/CFS patients had lower health-related qual-
ity of life than healthy controls, scoring significantly
lower in 7 of the 8 RAND-36 categories (all p-values <
0.05; Table 1). There were no differences in the average
age or BMI of the clinical groups. Principal component
analysis (PCA) was performed on the RAND-36 scores
in order to reduce the dimensionality of the variation
in scores across all categories to have a more interpret-
able measure of how overall score on the RAND-36
can distinguish between ME/CFS and controls. PCA
showed clear a separation between ME/CFS patients
and controls, with the first two principal components
(PCs) explaining 85.1% of the total variation in the data
(Additional file 1: Figure $1).

DNA methylome differences in ME/CFS

We observed 12,608 significant differentially methylated
loci in our cohort after correcting for age, BMI, and dif-
ferences in cell proportions (Additional file 2: Table $1).
For 5,544 of these loci, the probe was annotated to a
known protein coding gene according to the UCSC Gen-
ome Browser, indicating they were associated with genes.

The top 5 hypo- and hypermethylated sites according to
the magnitude of methylation differences are listed in
Table 2. In terms of the direction of methylation differ-
ences in ME/CFS patients compared to healthy controls,
71.6% of the differentially methylated loci were hyper-
methylated and 28.4% were hypomethylated (Additional
file 3: Figure S2A). We categorized probes according to
their annotated genic locations and their distance from a
known CpG island in order to determine if differential
methylation was enriched at particular regions in the
genome. While there were no significant differences in
proportion of hypo-/hypermethylated sites according to
genic location (Additional file 3: Figure $2B), there were
significant differences in these proportions when consider-
ing distance from a CpG island (Additional file 3: Figure
S2C). The amount of hypermethylation decreased as dis-
tance increased from a CpG island (p< 0.05, Additional
file 3: Figure S2C). Specifically, probes found in the N
Shore (up to 2 kb upstream of a CpG island), both N and
S Shelf regions (2-4 kb from a CpG island), and the Open
Sea (outside of Shelf regions) significantly differed in pro-
portion of hypo-/hypermethylation when compared to
CpG islands (all FDR < 0.05, Additional file 3: Figure S2C).
S Shelf probes also exhibited decreased hypermethylation
compared to neighboring S Shore probes (FDR < 0.05,
Additional file 3: Figure S2C).

Glucocorticoid sensitivity in PBMCs in ME/CFS subgroups

Overall, there was a significant mean increase in gluco-
corticoid sensitivity in PBMCs from ME/CFS patients com-
pared to healthy controls (y < 0.05). A visual inspection of
the data revealed a bimodal distribution of glucocorticoid
sensitivity within the ME/CFS cohort: a GC-Hypersensitive
group (circled in red in Fig. 1), who exhibited an increased
response to glucocorticoid treatment compared to the
mean control (p< 0.05) response, and a GC-Typical group
(p < 0.05; circled in blue in Fig. 1), who exhibited a response

Page 5 of 14

similar to the healthy controls in our clinical cohort. Differ-
ences in GC sensitivity were not associated with type of
ME/CFS onset or the RAND-36 survey when considering
scores on the overall survey or in particular categories (p >
0.10, all comparisons).

DNA methylation differences in dexamethasone assay
subgroups via pyrosequencing and permutation tests
To determine the association between differences in
DNA methylation and glucocorticoid sensitivity, we applied
the same statistical criteria used to identify methylation dif-
ferences between ME/CFS patients and healthy controls
(see Methods) to 3 different comparisons: 1) ME/CFS GC-
Hypersensitive vs. ME/CFS GC-Typical; 2) ME/CFS GC-
Hypersensitive vs. Controls; and 3) ME/CFS GC-Typical vs.
Controls. We found that no methylation differences met
these statistical criteria. However, a large number of loci
exhibited significant nominal Wilcoxon-rank sum test
p-values < 0.05. As alternative methods of examining
statistical confidence in the 3 glucocorticoid sensitivity
comparisons, we evaluated the differences found with the
450 K array via targeted bisulfite pyrosequencing and
genome-wide permutation of the data.

For pyrosequencing analysis, our strategy was to select
3 loci that showed nominally significant differences be-
tween ME/CFS GC-Hypersensitive and ME/CFS GC-
Typical: 2 loci in JRK and 1 locus in SLC6A4. These sites
were chosen to examine the reliability of the 450 K array
to detect significant differences both above and below
the 5% cutoff that we implemented to search for signifi-
cant differentially methylated sites in ME/CFS and to
specifically validate DNA methylation differences that
are both potentially related to GC sensitivity differences
as well as unique to ME/CFS (see Methods). The JRK
sites were selected for the following reasons: these were
among the top sites in terms of magnitude difference
that showed a >5% methylation difference on the 450 K

inal p = 0.017) and cg10596483 20.8% difference (nominal
p=0.014) between ME/CFS GC-Hypersensitive and ME/
CFS GC-Typical, and these sites were also close together
in the genome (5 bp apart), which allowed us to infer how
the DNA methylation status of a probe is reflected in
probes within the same annotated genic region. The
SLC6A4 site (cg20592995) was among the top sites show-
ing <5% difference based on magnitude difference, and
showed a 3% methylation difference (nominal p = 0.038)
on the 450 K array between ME/CFS GC-Hypersensitive
and ME/CFS GC-Typical. After pyrosequencing (primers
listed in Table 3), the JRK sites were declared to be signifi-
cant (p <0.05; Fig. 2a and b) or trending (py <0.10; Fig. 2B)
according to pyrosequencing results. However, the <5%
nominally significant difference found in the 450 K array
data for SLC6A4 was not significant in the bisulfite pyro-
sequencing assay (Fig. 2c), indicating that methylation
differences <5% on the 450 K array were not reliably
detected for these comparison conditions.

For permutation analysis, we examined the amount of
overlap between the sites with a >5% mean methylation
difference that were nominally significant on the 450 K

array according to the Wilcoxon rank-sum test and the
sites that were declared to be significantly different using
10,000 permutations. We found that a majority of the
nominally significant probes were also significant ac-
cording to the permutation test: 76.8% in the ME/CFS
GC-Hypersensitive vs. ME/CFS GC-Typical comparison,
84.5% in the ME/CFS GC-Hypersensitive vs. Control
comparison, and 99.6% in the ME/CFS GC-Typical vs.
Control comparison, indicating that the majority of
methylation differences that were nominally significant
with >5% mean methylation difference likely reflected
differential methylation.

Given these results, we implemented the 5% difference
cutoff across the various dexamethasone assay subgroup
comparisons, and examined sites that were found to be
significant using both the Wilcoxon rank-sum test and the
permutation test. To determine potential epigenomic loci
associated with glucocorticoid sensitivity, we examined the
overlap in nominally significant loci across the three com-
parisons (Additional file 4: Table S2; Fig. 3). There were 5
sites that were differentially methylated across all 3 com-
parisons (Additional file 4: Table S2); one of which corre-
sponded to a coding gene: NPAS3, a gene implicated in

methylated in both the ME/CFS GC-Hypersensitive vs.
Controls (green) and ME/CFS GC-Hypersensitive vs. ME/
CFS GC-Typical (blue) comparisons (Fig. 3). These loci,
listed in Table 4 (full annotation information in Additional
file 5: Table S3) with corresponding permutation results
(Additional file 6: Figure S3), are likely associated with
glucocorticoid sensitivity. The top 3 sites that showed the
greatest magnitude of differences when comparing ME/
CFS GC-Hypersensitive to GC-Typical subjects (ME/CFS
and Controls) were corresponded to GSTM1 (14.3% in-
crease in methylation), MYO3B (13.7% increase), and
GSTM5 (12.0% increase; Fig. 4). In addition to these gluco-
corticoid sensitive sites, we found 4,699 loci likely associ-
ated with ME/CFS, as they were differentially methylated
in the ME/CFS GC-Hypersensitive vs. Control (blue) and
ME/CFS GC-Typical vs. Control (red) comparisons (Fig. 3,
Additional file 7: Table 54). GO analysis of these sites
revealed an enrichment of differential methylation in
ME/CFS associated with regulatory processes, including
neuronal cell development, signal transduction, metabolic

regulation, and transcription regulation (Fig. 5, Additional
file 7: Table $4). There were 203 significant differentially
methylated sites that were unique to ME/CFS GC-Typical
subjects (Fig. 3, Additional file 8: Table S5), however no
GO terms were significantly associated with these sites.

Relationships between differentially methylated regions
and health-related quality of life

To examine the association of DNA methylation with
health-related quality of life, we used the first principal
component (PC1), explaining 68.4% of the variance in
RAND-36 scores (Additional file 1: Figure S1B), in our
linear regression analysis. We examined gene regions for
this analysis in order to to determine potential epige-
nomic regions that show a significant relationship with
quality of life scores. After linear regression analysis,
we found over 1,600 differentially methylated regions
with a >5% methylation difference between CFS and
controls that showed a significant relationship with
overall RAND-36 score (Additional file 9: Table S6). The
top 5 differentially methylated regions based on R* are

Discussion

In this study, we detected 12,608 differentially methyl-
ated sites in PBMCs of ME/CFS patients compared to
healthy controls, some of which were significantly asso-
ciated with self-reported quality of life health scores.

Table 4 Epigenetic loci associated with GC sensitivity in ME/CFS

71.6% of these sites were hypermethylated in ME/CFS
and hypermethylation was found to decrease as distance
from a CpG island increased, suggesting that epigenetic
dysregulation in ME/CFS significantly varies depending
on relative location to CpG islands. Within the ME/CFS
patient group, we observed two distinct subgroups based
on in vitro sensitivity to glucocorticoid exposure. The
difference in glucocorticoid sensitivity was associated
with differential methylation in 13 sites on the basis of

Top 5 regions based on R? that show a significant relationship between DNA methylation and overall RAND-36 score

electron transport chain metabolites [37] suggests a role
for processes affecting mitochondrial function in ME/
CFS pathology. There is a known relationship between
oxidative stress and epigenetic modifications. DNA le-
sions are often produced from oxidative stress states,
which in turn affect the multiple levels of epigenetic
regulation, leading to aberrant DNA methylation and
gene expression patterns [40]. It is possible that oxidative
stress, as indicated by the differences found in cellular and
metabolic regulation genes in our study including ARL4C
and HOXA11 (Additional file 2: Table $1; also see [41]),
may drive some of the epigenetic changes observed in
ME/CFS. However, additional work is required to explore
this relationship, such as characterizing the effect of
ARLAC and HOXA11 on DNA methylation patterns with
functional genomics experiments.

Genes associated with neuronal cell development were
also a major class of genes differentially methylated in
ME/CFS patients. At least two previous studies that ex-
amined gene expression patterns in PBMCs of ME/CFS
patients also reported significant differences genes in-
volving neuronal development and regulatory processes
[42, 43]. It is also known that genes associated with
psycho-neuroendocrine-immune pathways show rich ex-
pression profiles in PBMCs [44, 45]. DNA methylation
differences in neuronal genes in PBMCs could reflect
some central differences in psycho-neuroendocrine-
immune pathways in ME/CFS, as suggested by our
glucocorticoid sensitivity assay results, which aligns
with previous work identifying peripheral blood and
immune cells as suitable candidates reflective of DNA
methylation differences in central systems [46-48].

Dexamethasone response subgroups in ME/CFS

We observed a mean increase in glucocorticoid sensitiv-
ity in ME/CFS patients, which could not be explained
based on type of ME/CFS onset or quality of life. In
addition, a finer examination of our results revealed two
subgroups among ME/CFS patients. Mild hypocortiso-
lism and enhanced negative feedback to glucocorticoids
were observed in several studies of GC responses in
ME/CFS [3, 49]. The presence of both the GC-Typical
and GC-Hypersensitive subgroups within our ME/CFS

cohort thus aligns with the observed heterogeneity of
HPA-related differences in these previous reports.

Glucocorticoids are known for their anti-inflammatory
effects and are typically used to suppress immune re-
sponses. However, inappropriate response to glucocortic-
oid treatment is associated with increased susceptibility to
metabolic and cardiac diseases [50]. Our results using
PHA, a T cell mitogen, as an immune stressor indicate a
functional impairment in T cell GR sensitivity in ME/CFS
GC-Hypersensitive patients. Additional evidence suggests
that T cells are candidates for a primary immune cell
population in ME/CFS pathology. For example, a recent
GWAS found significant differences in polymorphisms as-
sociated with T cell receptors in ME/CFS patients [51]. In
addition, DNA methylation differences have been reported
in CD4+ T cells from ME/CFS patients [52], a cell popula-
tion that appears to show and increased dexamethasone
sensitivity in ME/CFS [53].

We found 13 sites associated with glucocorticoid sensi-
tivity in ME/CFS GC-Hypersensitive patients compared to
both GC-typical ME/CFS patients and healthy controls.
To our knowledge, no other EWAS or GWAS studies
have specifically examined epigenetic or genetic differ-
ences in the context of GC sensitivity. However, genomic
studies of ME/CFS have reported polymorphisms in GC
signaling genes in ME/CFS patients. Interestingly, these
genes do not appear to overlap with other disorders char-
acterized by impaired GC signaling [51, 54]. In addition,
FKBP5, a gene that was recently found to be differentially
methylated in Cushing’s syndrome [55], was not among
the genes identified in our study. At present, however,
the potential link between ME/CFS and epigenetic
modification of these genes should therefore be viewed
with caution. Nevertheless, the results suggest that epi-
genetic differences at these sites may provide useful in-
formation regarding associated GC sensitivity among
some ME/CFS patients.

Six of the 13 sites were part of known coding genes,
four of which have roles in cellular metabolism. Patatin
Like Phospholipase Domain Containing 4 (PNPLA4) is a
phospholipase that plays a role in lipid metabolism and
is highly expressed in metabolically active tissue [56].
PNPLAG is also part of the PNPLA family, which activates

upon glucocorticoid interaction [57]. D-aspartate Oxi-
dase (DDO) is an enzyme that deaminizes D-aspartate
and N-methyl D-aspartate, which is abundant in neu-
roendocrine tissue. Gene knockout studies of DDO in
mice have revealed that this enzyme is important in
melanocortin production [58] and involved in regulat-
ing basal corticosterone levels [59]. Phosphodiesterase
1C (PDE1C) is responsible for the hydrolysis of cyclic
nucleotides, which is important for physiological regula-
tion, calcium signaling pathways, and circadian rhythms
[60]. Cell culture work has shown that inhibition of
PDEIC via siRNA knockdown results in inhibited cell
proliferation [61] and that PDEIC is activated upon dexa-
methasone treatment [62].

The top 3 sites, based on magnitude difference between
ME/CFS GC-Hypersensitive and GC-Typical (ME/CFS
and control) subjects, corresponded to GSTM1, MYO3B,
and GSTM5, all of which showed >10% increase in methy-
lation. GSTM1 and GSTM5 are part of the mu class of
the GST gene family, whose primary role is the detoxifica-
tion of environmental and exogenous toxins, specifically
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons [63]. Genetic polymor-
phisms in GSTM are known to predict the potential re-
sponse to glucocorticoid treatment in acute childhood
lymphoblastic leukemia [64], indicating that GSTM
may have a significant role in glucocorticoid signaling
in immune cells. MYO3B is an ATPase that is acti-
vated by actin and is involved in kinase activity [65].
However, MYO3B and its various interactions remain
poorly characterized compared to other myosin genes,
making it unclear how differences in MYO3B may re-
late to glucocorticoid signaling.

The 13 differentially methylated sites could be consid-
ered to be biomarkers of glucocorticoid hypersensitivity,
however additional work is required to understand and
confirm the functional impact of hypermethylation on
these genes and its relationship to glucocorticoid signal-
ing. Gene knockout and RNA knockdown studies can
assist in determining the precise impact that these genes
have on glucocorticoid signaling. Measuring mRNA
transcripts, methylation differences, and protein levels of
these genes at baseline, PHA-stimulated, and DEX-
suppressed conditions both in vitro and in vivo would
provide a better understanding of the dynamics under-
lying GC sensitivity differences in ME/CFS.

DNA methylation modifications associated with quality of
life health scores

We found over 1600 differentially methylated regions that
were significantly associated with overall RAND-36 score
(Table 5; Additional file 10: Table S7), where variation in
methylation at these particular regions was significantly
associated with variation in the overall RAND-36 score.
Scores from this survey may point towards alterations in

Page 11 of 14

biological systems. Notably, of the top 5 differentially
methylated regions (Table 5), ATP6VOE2 (R? = 0.226) is an
isoform of the H(+)-ATPase VO e subunit, which is im-
portant for cellular energy [66], LOC401431 (R° = 0.224)
encodes the antisense RNA for ATP6VOE2 suggesting that
the regulation dynamics of this particular gene may be
affected in ME/CES, IL6R (R? = 0.220) encodes for the re-
ceptor of IL-6, a pleiotropic cytokine, and LOC144571 (R°
= 0.220) is the antisense RNA to alpha-2-macroglobulin, a
protease inhibitor and cytokine transporter. The low Phys-
ical Health scores in ME/CFS patients (Table 1) suggest
that the physical impairment in ME/CFS is associated with
an epigenetic imbalance of cellular energy, metabolism,
and immune signaling.

Conclusions

Here, we report DNA methylation differences in PBMCs
of ME/CFS patients, some of which were significantly
associated with overall quality of life as well as gluco-
corticoid hypersensitivity in a subgroup of ME/CFS pa-
tients. Notably, we determined epigenetic loci associated
with differences in glucocorticoid sensitivity (Table 4)
that may reflect underlying ME/CFS pathology in some
patients. Additional work is required to confirm the po-
tential mechanistic relationships between DNA methyla-
tion in these genes of interest, downstream gene
expression and protein profiles, and ME/CFS phenotype.
Longitudinal studies both in vivo and in vitro are needed
to assess the stability of these epigenetic modifications,
including changes in symptom profiles and in response
to glucocorticoid treatment. For example, cytokines such
as IL-10 and IFN-gamma, which were differentially
methylated in our study (Additional file 7: Table $4), are
known to interact with GR and show expression differ-
ences in vitro upon dexamethasone treatment [53, 67].
While GR density and binding affinity in ME/CFS
PBMCs do not appear to differ in steady state condi-
tions [4], GR is known to be upregulated during exer-
cise challenge in ME/CFS [68]. Future work should
examine DNA methylation signatures during exercise
challenge in ME/CFS in order to gain a better under-
standing of glucocorticoid signaling dynamics. Never-
theless, at the very least, the differentially methylated
sites identified in this study may be important as bio-
markers for future clinical testing in order to deter-
mine if epigenetic changes in these genes associate
with disease onset or progression.

The results of this study highlight the potential util-
ity of immune cell subtyping within the ME/CFS
population, and indicate that epigenetic data may aid
in elucidating relevant biological pathways impacted
by ME/CFS. Clinical investigations of the regulation
of cellular metabolism are needed to assess this possi-
bility, as we found that genes such as GSTMI,

--- Page 12 ---
de Vega et al. BMC Medical Genomics (2017) 10:11

MYO3B, GSTM5, and ATP6VOE2 showed significant
epigenetic modifications in ME/CFS. Increased under-
standing of ME/CFS subtypes will assist patients and
physicians to determine the appropriate interventions
to treat symptoms and improve personal health.

Abstract

Chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis is a debilitating illness that greatly impacts the lives of sufferers.
A cognitive behavioural model attempts to explain illness onset and continuance with a hypothesis that the illness is
perpetuated by patients’ irrational beliefs and avoidance behaviours. This theory underpins the promotion of cognitive
behavioural therapy, a treatment that aims to change beliefs and behaviours. This article reports on a detailed review
of the cognitive behavioural model. Our review finds that the model lacks high-quality evidential support, conflicts with
accounts given by most patients and fails to account for accumulating biological evidence of pathological and physiological
abnormalities found in patients. There is little scientific credibility in the claim that psycho-behavioural therapies are a

primary treatment for this illness.

Introduction

Myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME) is a post-infectious disease,
causing lingering malaise, muscle weakness and nervous sys-
tem complaints, primarily pain, cognitive dysfunction and
sleep disturbance, described as far back as the 1950s (Ramsay,
1957). Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is an alternative label
introduced in the late 1980s to describe a syndrome of chronic
unexplained fatigue (Holmes, 1988). There has been some
controversy whether or not the ‘fatigue syndrome’ of CFS
covers Ramsay’s ME disease. However, the two terms are
often used in combination in the literature (Jason et al., 2003),
thus we will use ‘ME/CFS’ in this article, or ‘CFS’ if referenc-
ing a study that only uses the term CFS. Prevalence rates vary
widely across studies, but around 0.5 per cent is a commonly
reported figure for adults (Nacul et al., 2011). Several diag-
nostic criteria have been proposed to help identify potential
cases. In the United Kingdom, the National Institute for
Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends a diagnosis
after 4 months of persistent unexplained fatigue, that is not
relieved by rest and results in a substantial loss of normal

physical or social function (Baker and Shaw, 2007). The US
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) criteria
requires a set of characteristic symptoms (Fukuda, 1994),
while other criteria require the presence of post-exertional
neuro-immune exhaustion (Carruthers et al., 2011).

A wide range of treatments have been tested on ME/CFS
patients, ranging from drug therapies, mainly antidepressants
and immunological modulators, to non-pharmacological ther-
apies, predominantly psycho-behavioural therapies (Smith
et al., 2015). Over the last two decades, cognitive behavioural
therapy (CBT) and graded exercise therapy (GET) have

gained prominence. Patients with ME/CFS are prescribed a
modified form of CBT to challenge their illness beliefs (cogni-
tions) and GET to increase their activity levels and diminish
their alleged fear-avoidance behaviour (Sharpe, 1998; Sharpe
et al., 1991). The symptoms that many patients present with,
such as fatigue or pain, are posited to be ‘maintained’ by ‘dys-
functional illness beliefs’, embedded within a social and health
system that rewards illness behaviours (Halligan and Aylward,
2006; Wessely, 1997). The rationale for the use of CBT and
exercise therapies is linked to a so-called ‘Cognitive
Behavioural Model of CFS’ (CBM) that is set out as a theoreti-
cal framework for illness onset and continuance (Surawy
et al., 1995; Wessely et al., 1989). This CBM emerged in the
early 1990s and has remained largely intact, influencing clini-
cal guidelines for diagnosis and therapeutic approaches for
ME/CFS.

Challenges to the CBM, in terms of efficacy and appli-
cability, are scant in the literature and have not addressed
the CBM in totality. Various studies have shown that
patients do not possess some of the personality or behav-
ioural characteristics deemed targets of treatment in the
CBM (Song and Jason, 2005; Sunnquist and Jason, 2018).
More recently, the model has come under scrutiny follow-
ing publication of controversial clinical trials of CBT-
GET, such as the PACE trial (Pacing, graded Activity, and
Cognitive behaviour therapy: a randomised Evaluation)
and the FINE trial (Fatigue Intervention by Nurses
Evaluation) (Wearden et al., 2010; White et al., 2011) that
sought to validate the CBM. Findings from these trials
resulted in criticism that the efficacy of these treatments is
poor (Geraghty and Blease, 2016; Wilshire et al., 2018).
The PACE trial reported a recovery rate of 22 per cent
using CBT, whereas re-analysis of data from PACE puts
recovery below 10 per cent (Chalder et al., 2017; Geraghty,
2017a; Wilshire et al., 2016) — only little higher than the
recovery rate observed in the de facto control group of
usual medical care (Sharpe et al., 2015). Clinicians and
medical philosophers argue that the CBM of ME/CFS
downplays the severity of the illness, stigmatising suffer-
ers with claims that recovery from the illness is dependent
on a patient’s efforts and engagement in psychotherapy
(Blease et al., 2017; Komaroff, 2015). In response, we
undertake a detailed review of the ‘cognitive behavioural
model of ME/CFS’ to assess model applicability and
validity. We provide a brief description of the origins and
antecedents of the CBM and its key features. We summa-
rise how the CBM has been applied in practice, drawing
on evidence from clinical trials and practice. We reveal
how the model is often inconsistent, contradictory and
lacking in a unifying logic. We pinpoint weaknesses in
CBM theory and highlight evidence that disproves or
challenges the central tenets of the CBM. Specifically, we
discuss how the CBM is biased towards the psycho-social
(viewing cognitions and behaviours in ME/CFS as dys-
functional rather than rational), while neglecting to

account for an increasing array of evidence of biological
abnormalities found in ME/CFS patients.

The CBM of ME/CFS

CBT originated in the ground-breaking work of Beck in the
1960s and 1970s, as an experimental psychological treat-
ment for depression (Beck, 1976). Since then, the applica-
tion of CBT has widened to the treatment of anxiety,
phobias, obsessive compulsive disorders and more recently,
ME/CFS (Wessely et al., 1989). In the United Kingdom, in
the late 1980s/early 1990s, psychiatrists proposed that
Beck’s CBT could be used to treat ME/CFS. A model of
CFS was proposed by psychiatry that dismissed Ramsay’s
ME organic infectious disease in favour of a mostly psy-
chogenic model of CFS. The ‘cognitive behavioural model’
of CFS is Beck’s CBT modified and applied to CFS. In this
sense, the CBM of ME/CFS is distinct from Beck’s CBM
for depression — and must be assessed on its own merits.

The CBM is framed around three interconnecting illness
factors (‘precipitating’, ‘predisposing’ and ‘perpetuating’) —
“3Ps’. This framework may originate from Lang et al.’s
three-system model of fear maintenance and desensitisation
(Lang et al., 1970). ME/CFS is viewed as an illness contin-
ued by fearful cognitions that limit patients’ activities,
whereby experiences of physiological symptoms — such as
pain or fatigue — reinforce unwanted cognitions and avoid-
ance behaviours. In the CBM, the aim of treatment is to
address ‘unhelpful’ cognitions and behaviours that are
hypothesised to maintain the illness (Butler et al., 1991;
Wessely et al., 1989). The CBM of CFS is discussed concep-
tually by Wessely et al. (1989) and is formulated as a theo-
retical model by Surawy et al. (1995). Surawy et al.’s paper
draws on clinical observations from the treatment of 100
CFS patients at a hospital in Oxford, UK (Sharpe, 1993).

The CBM is also embedded within a grand biopsycho-
social (BPS) model in which biological, social and psycho-
logical factors are regarded as important in understanding
illness (Engel, 1977). Moss-Morris et al. (2013) state that
‘It is unlikely that CFS can be understood through one aeti-
ological [mechanism]. Rather it is a complex illness which
is best explained in terms of a multi-factorial cognitive
behavioural model’ (p. 303). A CBM is said to capture the
complexity of CFS — it connects the 3Ps within a BPS
framework (as illustrated in Table 1).

Abbey argues that CFS patients attribute their illness to
a physical cause, such as a virus; however, given clinical
investigations often find no evidence of ongoing viral ill-
ness (from routing blood tests for example), such beliefs
must be ‘... illness attributions and dysfunctional auto-
matic thoughts and cognitive distortions in patients with
CFS’ (Abbey, 1993). Physical illness attribution cognitions
are a target for cognitive behaviour therapy, which aims to
“... optimize patients’ level of physical and psychosocial
functioning’ (Abbey, 1993). CBT seeks to reverse so-called

dysfunctional beliefs. Wessely et al. (1998) argue that a
belief in organic illness stops an ME/CFS patient engaging
in normal activities, resulting in avoidance behaviour.
Unfortunately, neither Abbey nor Wessely proffer evidence
that ME/CFS patients’ beliefs are indeed dysfunctional. An
assumption is simply made that if no standard underlying
disease pathology can be found to account for ME/CFS
patients’ symptoms, a belief in disease or infection on the
part of the ME/CFS sufferer is irrational. We shall show
later in this article that considerable evidence of abnormal
biology exists in ME/CFS — rendering the dysfunctional
beliefs theory misguided and inaccurate.

Abbey (1993) goes on to write, ‘The CBT programme is
predicated on an “alternative view” of CFS which posits that
rest and avoidance, which may have been adaptive during the
acute phase of the illness, are deleterious and perpetuate disa-
bility later in its course’. Abbey also postulates that CBT helps
with ‘learned helplessness’, a concept discussed by Seligman
(1975) to describe a feeling of losing control of thought and
one’s life and falling into a pit of depression (Maier and
Seligman, 1976). CFS is viewed as analogous to depression
and is said to be linked to somatic and psychological distress
(Wessely et al., 1996). Proponents of the CBM write,

cognitive behavioural models propose that beliefs about the
unacceptability of experiencing or expressing negative
thoughts and emotions can play a central role in the
development and maintenance of clinical problems and can be
associated with a poorer prognosis or treatment outcome.
(Rimes and Chalder, 2010)

Here, a new layer of theory is introduced, that ME/CFS
is somehow related to a problem with expressing emotion.
CBT aims to help patients consider other, less threatening
explanations for their symptoms and pulls the victim out of
a downward spiral of depressive thinking, somatising and
catastrophising (Sharpe, 2007; Wessely et al., 1998). The
aim of therapy is reattribution of beliefs and reversal of
depressive-anxious thoughts and avoidance behaviours.

We note at this point, that it is clinicians, mostly psychia-
trists, acting as the arbitrator of what is a ‘useful belief’ or a
“dysfunctional belief’ and what ‘alternative explanations’
should be given to ME/CFS patients. Such strategies may

have merit in illnesses such as obsessive compulsive disor-
der, where a patient might think that eating in a cafe is going
to cause great harm due to exposure to germs — the patient’s
fears are challenged with the rational argument that eating in
a cafe is unlikely to cause any harm. However, in ME/CFS,
the application of this approach lacks a rational alternative
explanation. Most patients report that their illness started
after an infection and an increasing body of literature links
ME/CFS to infections and immune alterations post infection
(we discuss later in article). The CBM aims to change
patients’ unhelpful thoughts and experiences of symptoms
(pain, fatigue and malaise) with supplanted alternatives. ‘I
am sick, | think its related to an infection, | am tired’ (patient)
to ‘you do not have an organic disease, resting is harmful,
you can do activities’ (CBT therapist).

Sharpe (2007, citing Wessely et al., 1989) concedes that
the theory behind the use of CBT in CFS is weak: ‘... treat-
ment is plausible, but lacks a theoretical rationale. It is pos-
sible to construct a hypothetical model by assuming that the
aforementioned factors interact in self-perpetuating vicious
circles’. The notion of ‘a cycle’ is repeated throughout the
CBM literature. Butler et al. (1991) state that “The result is a
vicious circle of symptoms, avoidance, fatigue, demoralisa-
tion and depression-the clinical picture of CFS’. Deary et al.
(2007) state that ‘The sine qua non of any CBM is a vicious
circle, the hypothesis that a self-perpetuating interaction
between different domains maintains symptoms, distress and
disability’ (p. 782). This rudimentary hypothesised cycle is
outlined by Surawy et al. (1995) and again by Sharpe (2007)
and others (Harvey and Wessely, 2009) — that CFS may begin
with a viral infection, which leads to symptoms such as
fatigue or pain, which cause a sufferer to rest and become
fearful of activity (perpetuated by beliefs about organic ill-
ness), whereby avoidance behaviours lead to anxiety and
depression, which exacerbate physiological and mental
deconditioning (model derived by Sharpe, 1993, 2007). This
cyclical model is similar to the fear-avoidance model of
chronic pain (Crombez et al., 2012). Figure | represents an
illustration of the CBM and the factors and components of
the model. An assertion is made that by addressing one or
more factors, such as unhelpful cognitions/behaviours, cata-
strophising, or anxiety and fear avoidance, CBT is able to
halt the perpetuation of the illness (Petrie et al., 1995).

Social influences (Figure 1) are another layer in the
model narrative said to sustain CFS: the rewards of the
sick-role, social care benefits and peer support in sickness
(Halligan and Aylward, 2006). The assertion is made that a
return to normal activity would result in the loss of such
social benefits and that ME/CFS sufferers remain sick to
avail sick-role benefits (Becker, 1952). Again, a speculative
narrative is proposed with little evidential support. Overall,
the CBM impacts ME/CFS sufferers’ access to disability/
social and medical support (Sharpe and Wessely, 1998;
Wessely, 1997; Wessely et al., 1998). The CBM is utilised
as a theoretical framework for both the testing of CBT-GET
in clinical trials and as a rationale for treatment of ME/CFS
in clinical practice.

Limited model validation

Vercoulen et al. (1998) used structural equation modelling
to generate a CBM of CFS with factors such as beliefs
about the disease being somatic linked with fatigue out-
comes. Vercoulen et al.’s (1998) model characterises
patients with CFS as having insufficient motivation for
physical activity or recovery, lacking an internal locus of
control, and maintaining a self-defeating preoccupation
with symptoms (Vercoulen et al., 1998). This model is

almost identical to that of Surawy et al. (1995) and has
largely remained intact up to the present day, as the basic
rationale behind the use of CBT in the treatment of ME/
CFS (White et al., 2007). Success in bringing about
improvement in symptoms, or full recovery, is said to dem-
onstrate the explanatory power of the CBM (Sharpe,
1998). However, as we detail below, the evidence-base for
CBT and GET in ME/CFS is highly contested and prob-
lematic. Researchers have also sought to validate the CBM
using mediation analysis, a statistical method to test how a
mediating variable transmits the effect of an independent
variable onto a dependent variable. Stahl et al. (2014)
sought to validate CBT efficacy in CFS by testing the role
of ‘fearful cognitions’ as a mediator between avoidance
behaviour and illness outcomes (e.g. fatigue). While such
studies appear to support the hypothesis that ‘illness
beliefs’ mediate fatigue in CFS, it is important to remem-
ber that mediation analysis is a correlation test that does
not prove causality. Stahl et al. (2014) concede that the
positive effects that they observed using CBT could have
been brought about by other factors or treatments.
Essentially, any type of one-to-one talk therapy might
reduce symptomology in ME/CFS, given that sufferers
experience distress, anxiety, depression and social isola-
tion. Here, any success using CBT in ME/CFS may result

from general treatment effect (Geraghty and Blease, 2018),
rather than cognitive or behavioural restructuring.

Song and Jason (2005) attempted to validate Vercoulen
et al.’s (1998) CBM in a US community sample and found
that the model fit better for individuals with fatigue from
psychiatric disorders but not for patients with CFS. Song
and Jason found little support for the idea that ME/CFS is
an illness maintained by sufferers’ beliefs. Jason et al.
(2007) observed improvements in quality-of-life scores fol-
lowing CBT in CFS, but noted in a later study (Jason et al.,
2007, 2008) that ‘improvers’ may be quite different in pro-
file from ‘non-improvers’, particularly in immune profiles.
ME/CES is difficult to diagnose, and clinical trials of CBT
for ME/CFS often include patients with psychiatric condi-
tions who may respond positively to psychotherapy,
whereas sufferers with post-infectious profiles often fail to
respond. In the study of Deale and Wessely (2001), 82 per
cent of a group of CFS patients referred to a UK hospital-
based specialist CFS clinic reported being prescribed anti-
depressants. Jason et al. (2009) found that 38 per cent of
patients with major depressive disorder were misclassified
as having CFS. Essentially, many ME/CFS studies are vul-
nerable to illness misclassification, rendering evidence
from these studies unreliable (Nacul et al., 2017).

Problematic evidence from clinical
trials and practice

Proponents of the CBM consistently argue that the model is
validated via the success of CBT and GET in randomised
controlled trials and clinical practice. It would be impossi-
ble to critique all CBT trial evidence within the confines of
this article, thus we point readers to reviews of the field
(Rimbaut et al., 2016) and systematic reviews (Larun et al.,
2016; Price et al., 2008) that appear to show, prima facie,
that CBT and GET outperform other treatments for ME/
CFS (mostly usual care) with small-to-modest effect sizes.
However, this evidence is increasingly contested by re-
analysis of data from clinical trials (Geraghty et al., 2017;
Wilshire et al., 2018) and meta-reviews (Vink and Vink-
Niese, 2018).

Many patients seen in CFS treatment studies appear to
be drawn from psychiatric centres with high rates of psy-
chiatric morbidity. In the study of Wessely and Powell
(1989), 22 (47%) patients met the criteria for major depres-
sive disorder. The inclusion of patients with mental health
complaints that might explain their presenting fatigue is a
contamination issue that persists to this day in clinical trials
of CBT treatment for ME/CFS (Taylor et al., 2003). In
Wessely and Powell’s work, approximately half of patients
with CFS were indistinguishable from the control patients
with psychiatric disorders, except for illness attribution and
CFS diagnosis. Butler et al. (1991) conducted a study using
CBT on CFS outpatients at the National Hospital for
Nervous Diseases in London (50 patients received an

average of 7.5 hours CBT). Butler et al. reported that CBT
led to substantial reductions in fatigue, mood problems and
psychiatric complaints (60% of patients improved).
However, 18 patients (36%) rejected treatment at recruit-
ment and 5 dropped out mid-way, leaving a strong bias
towards improvers.

The first, large randomised trial of immune therapy and
CBT for patients with CFS in Australia found no benefit for
CBT (alone or in combination) over nonspecific treatment
regimens (Lloyd et al., 1993). Sharpe et al. (1996) recruited
60 CFS patients to a randomised controlled trial (RCT) in
Oxford and reported that almost three quarters of patients
given CBT improved versus one quarter in standard medi-
cal care. Around the same time, Wessely conducted an RCT
with CFS patients, 30 given CBT and 30 given relaxation
therapy (Deale et al., 1997). Astonishingly, 70 per cent in
the CBT arm (19 of 27) went from bed-ridden levels of
reported physical health (mean score of 25 on 36-Item
Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) questionnaire) to near-
perfect physical health (mean score: 70+) post treatment.
Deale et al. (1997) reported that CBT changed physical
function from an average baseline SF-36 score of 24.7 to an
average score as high as 85.1 for improvers. However, 20
out of 30 participants in the CBT arm reported present or
past psychiatric illness, including major depressive disor-
der (Deale et al., 1997). Recall, Beck designed CBT as a
treatment for depression. Review of this study suggests that
many patients were likely depressed patients given a CFS
diagnosis using the Oxford criteria (Sharpe et al., 1991).

After the year 2000, the number of clinical trials of psy-
cho-behavioural treatments for ME/CFS accelerated.
Moss-Morris et al. (2005) observed a greater decrease in
self-rated fatigue using GET in a trial of GET on 25 CFS
patients and 24 CFS controls given standard care. However,
SF-36 physical health scores differed little between groups
at follow-up and many CFS patients refused to undertake
physiological exercise tests (10 patients reported that test-
ing harmed them and 5 could not reach maximal effort in
testing; Moss-Morris et al., 2005). Wiborg et al. (2010)
observed that reduced fatigue in three randomised trials of
CBT was not mirrored by an increase in physical activity as
measured objectively with actometers. Essentially, in CBT-
GET RCTs that report evidence of improvement in subjec-
tive self-reported fatigue, there is often little or no evidence
of objective improvement in physical fitness or function.

The largest clinical trial of CBT-GET in ME/CFS, the
PACE trial, reported a 60-per cent-plus improvement rate
and a 22-per cent recovery rate using CBT plus standard
medical care, compared with just 7 per cent recovery for
standard medical care only (Sharpe et al., 2015; White
et al., 2011). This trial has attracted criticism after it was
discovered that the authors deviated from their published
trial protocol and lowered key measurement criteria mid-
trial (Geraghty, 2017b). Re-analysis using the published
trial protocol reveals a recovery rate for CBT closer to 7 per

cent (not the 22% reported; Geraghty, 2017a; Wilshire
et al., 2016). The PACE trial also demonstrated that little
improvement in objective tests of physical function and the
size of between-group differences (CBT-GET vs pacing
therapy or standard medical care) was not sustained at
2-year follow-up (Chalder et al., 2015; Geraghty, 2017a;
Sharpe et al., 2015). Interestingly, Wessely et al.’s 1990s’
RCT reported a 50-per cent recovery rate at trial end, yet
only a 26-per cent recovery rate at 5-year follow-up and
most of the patients classed as ‘recovered’ continued to
report considerable problems with fatigue (Deale et al.,
2001). A sister trial of the PACE trial, the FINE trial, found
no substantive benefits over standard care using home-
based nurse-provided CBT-GET in CFS patients at 70
weeks (Wearden et al., 2010). Across RCTs, recovery rates
are inconsistent, do not mirror objective scoring of improve-
ment and fall away over the long term.

Outside the confines of carefully managed clinical trials,
data from UK specialist CBT National Health Service
(NHS) clinics do little to support the use of CBT-GET in
ME/CES. In one recent study, 5.7 per cent of CFS patients
reported no longer having the illness after NHS treatment
ends (Collin and Crawley, 2017). This equates to 94.3 per
cent of patients sent to CBT centres reporting ME/CFS sta-
tus post treatment. Why are most ME/CFS patients not
recovering using CBT or GET? A systematic review of
prognosis in CFS finds a full recovery rate of just 5 per cent
(Cairns and Hotopf, 2005). It is important to note that in
clinical trials and practice, studies involve ambulatory ME/
CES patients well enough to attend full courses of treat-
ment (milder cases) — while those bedbound or housebound
with moderate-to-severe ME/CFS are absent. Any modest
reported benefits using CBT or GET are not generalisable
to the whole ME/CFS population. The FINE trial sought to
remedy this limitation by testing CBT-GET provision in the
homes of CFS patients, but failed to show significant ben-
efits over usual care at follow-up (Wearden et al., 2010).
There are also a range of biases in CBT-GET trials that
influence results, such as design biases, therapy effects or
expectancy effects — discussed elsewhere (Geraghty and
Blease, 2018). Clearly, this problematic evidence-base does
little to validate the CBM of ME/CFS.

Failure to rationalise evidence of
biological dysfunction (pathology)

The CBM of ME/CFS inextricably fails to explain the ori-
gins and impact of symptoms specific to ME/CFS; the
commonest symptoms reported in the illness are pain,
fatigue, sleep disturbance and cognitive dysfunction. In the
CBM, pain is theorised to be the result of patients somatis-
ing or overly focusing on bodily sensations (Lane et al.,
1991), whereas studies of pain in ME/CFS reveal that
patients experience widespread muscular, joint pain and
headaches (Marshall et al., 2010). Meeus and Nijs (2007)

offer an explanation that pain in ME/CFS might originate
from increased central neuronal responsiveness. The
authors speculate that this mechanism is triggered by infec-
tion, leading to sensitisation of the spinal cord (including
wind-up or temporal summation, dysregulated descending
inhibitory pathways and upregulated facilitatory modula-
tion) in response to repetitive noxious stimuli that cause an
increase in electrical discharges in the dorsal horn. In addi-
tion, inhibitory modulation may be impaired (Meeus and
Nijs, 2007). Here, pain is the result of insult in the central
nervous system and post-infection pathophysiological
responses (Underhill, 2015).

Fatigue after exertion, a cardinal symptom of ME/CFS,
is said to be associated with ‘too much rest after the initial
infection stage’ by CBM promoters (Moss-Morris et al.,
2013; Sharpe, 1998). The patient is said to bring about
‘physiological deconditioning’ by avoiding activity
(Browne and Chalder, 2006; Surawy et al., 1995). However,
this view is not evidence-based but merely hypothesised
via a narrative. Moss-Morris (2005) writes,

The common response to a physical illness is rest. However,
reduced activity conflicts with achievement orientation and
may result in bursts of activity in an attempt to meet
expectations. These periodic bursts of activity inevitably
exacerbate symptoms and result in failure, which further
reinforces the belief that they have a serious illness. As time
goes by, efforts to meet previous standards of achievement are
abandoned and patients become increasingly preoccupied with
their symptoms and illness. This results in chronic disability
and the belief that one has an ongoing incurable illness which
may be eventually diagnosed as CFS. (p. 224)

Proponents of the CBM also assert the notion of a
“boom-bust cycle’ or ‘all or nothing behaviour’ to account
for patients’ reports of symptom flare following activity
(Deary et al., 2007). Many ME/CFS sufferers experience
post-exertional malaise (PEM), a worsening of symptoms
following activity caused by physiological and cellular
changes (Chu et al., 2018), including activation of immune
cytokines and increases in cellular lactate levels (Twisk,
2015). Researchers studying PEM state that this response
cannot be explained by physiological deconditioning alone
(Cook et al., 2017). A series of studies of exercise capacity,
including cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET), reveal the
pathophysiology underlying the PEM in ME/CFS patients
is a characteristic of the disease, not seen in healthy con-
trols or sedentary controls (Stevens et al., 2018). Such evi-
dence is often ignored by CBM authors. Patients with ME/
CFS are 10.4 times more likely to experience PEM com-
pared with healthy controls (Brown and Jason, 2018). In
contrast, the CBM interprets patients’ reduction in activity
as ‘fear avoidance behaviour’ (Browne and Chalder, 2006;
Chalder et al., 2017) and does not consider patients’ avoid-
ance of activity as a rational response to PEM (Sharpe,
1998; Wessely et al., 1989; White et al., 2007). Yet,

evidence of biological dysfunction (loss of homeostasis)
and neuro-immune events, in many ME/CFS sufferers
(Komaroff et al., 2018; Monro and Puri, 2018), aligns with
patients’ accounts of the illness.

The US Institute of Medicine (LOM) in 2015 conducted
an extensive review of the literature, including expert testi-
monies from the most prominent US ME/CFS experts and
concluded that ME/CFS is a ‘serious biological illness’.
Similarly, the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) con-
cluded that ME/CFS is ‘not a primary psychological dis-
ease’ (Green et al., 2015). Both the IOM and NIH point to a
range of biological/physiological abnormalities observed in
patients, including immune dysfunction, cardiac dysfunc-
tion and neuro-cognitive deficits. Notable studies include
findings of biological markers indicative of energy metabo-
lism dysfunction (Armstrong et al., 2012; Fluge et al.,
2016; Germain et al., 2017; Naviaux et al., 2016) that partly
explains the origins of fatigue experienced by sufferers; or
findings of neurological inflammatory markers and gross
inflammation and anatomical changes (Finkelmeyer et al.,
2018; Lange et al., 1999; Nakatomi et al., 2014; Shan et al.,
2016); and evidence of systemic immune activation (Brenu
et al., 2011; Hornig et al., 2016; Landi et al., 2016; Montoya
et al., 2017; Smylie et al., 2013). This small fraction of
building evidence points to a ‘neuro-immune-cellular dys-
function model’ of ME/CFS that explains the symptoms
reported by patients: pain, fatigue, cognitive dysfunction
and malaise after effort.

A major limitation of the CBM is that it does not fully
consider the role of pathogens in ME/CFS. For instance,
research has shown that ME/CFS is linked with exposure to
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), Coxsackie B, human herpes
virus (HHV) 6 and 7, and Coxiella burnetii (Katafuchi
et al., 2005; Underhill, 2015; Wuest et al., 2014). Chia and
Chia (2008) proposed a link between ME/CFS and entero-
virus infection in the stomach after 135 of 165 CFS patient
(82%) biopsies stained positive for VP1 within parietal
cells versus just 7 of 34 (20%) healthy controls. Clearly,
infectious agents are a risk factor in ME/CFS onset. The
CBM accepts that viruses might trigger ME/CFS initiation,
but the CBM fails to consider that infections and immune/
cellular disruption post infection may account for the symp-
toms reported in ME/CFS. ‘Viruses may not be either nec-
essary nor sufficient for the development of CFS’ (Wessely
and Powell, 1989). In fact, CBM promoters suggest that
ME/CES patients do not have organic illness or biological
dysfunction caused by infection, but rather irrational cogni-
tions or illness attributions. However, outside of ME/CFS,
it is known that common HHVs cause a range of acute and
chronic illnesses, including encephalitis/meningitis (herpes
simplex virus type | (HSV-1) and HSV-2, and HHV-6),
shingles, chicken pox (varicella zoster), hearing loss, mon-
onucleosis and post-viral fatigue syndrome (EBV),
Kaposi’s sarcoma (HHV-8), and atherosclerosis, hearing
loss, mental retardation, retinitis (human cytomegalovirus

(HMCV)) and multiple sclerosis (HHV-6 and EBV) (De
Bolle et al., 2005; Wuest et al., 2014). Montoya et al. (2017)
have implicated herpes viruses as a likely trigger for the
inflammatory immune profiles observed in ME/CFS
patients. Despite growing evidence of biological irregulari-
ties in ME/CFS patients and almost exclusive accounts
from patients that the illness starts after an infection, CBM
proponents continue to ignore evidence that does not sup-
port their preferred model.

Inconsistency in CBM and
contradictory evidence

Wessely (2001), an architect of the CBM of ME/CFS and
the CBT-GET treatment paradigm, writes in a 2001 JAMA
editorial that,

. even though these interventions appear effective, the
evidence is based on a small number of studies and neither
approach is remotely curative’... and that ‘these interventions
are not the answer to CFS but, based on currently available
evidence, seem to be among the best available options’.

Wessely affirms that CBT and GET are not curative treat-
ments but are the only viable options in the absence of other
treatments. This statement is a stark contradiction to much of
the discourse we observed in the literature, where it is often
suggested that CBT-GET treatments are curative (such as in
the PACE trial), where a patient was deemed ‘recovered’ if
they no longer met specified criteria (White et al., 2007).
However, the low level of recovery observed in clinical trials
and clinical practice counters claims that the illness can be
cured using psycho-behavioural therapies.

In a 2010 paper titled ‘The central role of cognitive pro-
cesses in the perpetuation of chronic fatigue syndrome’,
Knoop et al. (2010) write, ‘The problem with all models is
that they are not based on longitudinal data ... So, although
the cognitive behavioral models of CFS helped in under-
standing CFS, they lack in specificity and empirical founda-
tion’ (p. 490). An inspection of the major psycho-social
factors said to perpetuate ME/CFS in the CBM reveals sig-
nificant inconsistent and contradictory evidence. For exam-
ple, in a prospective cohort study in New Zealand following
patients with glandular fever (EBV) to see which ones
developed CFS (Moss-Morris et al., 2011), a list of 13-14
cognitive behavioural risk factors was investigated. At 6
months (CFS status), 17 EBV sufferers were given a CFS
diagnosis from a cohort of 217. The study showed that many
cognitive behavioural factors were not associated with CFS
onset. Major factors, such as ‘patients limiting activity’,
‘perfectionism’ or ‘holding beliefs about infection’ showed
no risk association (Moss-Morris, 2005) and for those vari-
ables with positive correlations, such as ‘all-or-nothing
behaviour’, odds ratios remained low. However, the paper
abstract states that ‘The findings from this study provide

--- Page 8 ---
Health Psychology Open

support for the cognitive behavioural model and a good
basis for developing prevention and early intervention strat-
egies for CFS [CBT]’ (Moss-Morris et al., 2011). The study
also has major shortcomings. In total, 17 EBV patients were
classed as CFS with an average age of 19 years. Many of the
constructs studied were devised by the authors. This study,
based on a small non-clinically diagnosed sample of adoles-
cents with linked EBV, does not offer ‘good evidence’ of the
predictive value of psycho-social factors.

We observe that CBM proponents iterate a role for psy-
chological factors, even where there is contradictory evi-
dence. For example, Moss-Morris et al. found no association
with perfectionism in CFS onset and Wessely found that
perfectionism did not play a role in CFS (Wood and
Wessely, 1999), yet ‘perfectionism’ is claimed to be a factor
in CFS maintenance (Browne and Chalder, 2006). A study
of personality disorder rates among CFS patients in Finland
found no difference between rates among CFS sufferers (”
= 50) and healthy controls (n = 50) (Courjaret et al., 2009).
A case-control study tested whether patients with CFS have
exercise phobia (fear of activity), by measuring anxiety-
related physiological and psychological reactions to ordi-
nary activity and exercise (Gallagher et al., 2005). A total of
42 CFS patients were compared with 42 controls with no
illness but sedentary behaviour. CFS sufferers had signifi-
cantly more fatigue, sleep disturbance, anxiety and depres-
sion, compared with controls at baseline. Results revealed
that CFS patients did not have exercise phobia — there was
no increase in symptomatic anxiety. The authors write, *...
there was no more anticipatory avoidant behaviour in CFS
patients compared with healthy controls’ (Gallagher et al.,
2005: 371-372). The authors go on to state that,

As both groups were equally sedentary and inactive, this
suggests that fatigue was not caused by current levels of
inactivity. The results from the psychological measures lend
support to some of the perpetuating factors suggested by the
cognitive—behavioural model for CFS ... (p. 371)

The authors do not specify what ‘perpetuating factors’
remain viable in their own study. Here, we evidence the
authors subjectively interpret data to support the CBM in
the face of contradictory evidence. What is remarkable is
that White et al. proposed avoidance behaviour due to fear
of exercise as the theoretical basis of an early RCT of GET
in the 1990s (Fulcher and White, 1997, 1998) and as a theo-
retical basis for the PACE trial (White et al., 2007). We find
numerous examples of confirmation bias and selective
interpretation of evidence across the CBM literature. There
is a tendency to search out evidence to support the theory
underpinning the CBM of ME/CFS while contradictory or
conflicting evidence is often ignored.

The imputation of a behaviourist rationale in the CBM
is beautifully exemplified in a study by Sharpe et al. of
166 patients followed-up after being seen at an Oxford

hospital infectious disease clinic. Sharpe et al. (1992)
identified a number of variables that correlated with func-
tional impairment: ‘belief in a viral illness’, ‘membership
of a patient ME group’, ‘emotional disorder’ and ‘alcohol
avoidance’. Sharpe et al. speculated that these factors are
important in explaining ‘perpetuation of CFS’, but also
conceded that the direction of causality might be in
reverse. Essentially, being more ill for a longer period
might influence patients to join a support group, feel
depressed, avoid alcohol or hold a belief of an underlying
illness. This encapsulates the selective and narrative
nature of the CBM, where inferences are made from asso-
ciations between variables that often have alternative
explanations. In the CBM, speculative reasoning (that
holding beliefs of a physical illness increases the risk of
ME/CFS onset) is postulated over the more obvious rea-
soning (that ME/CFS patients who suffer chronic ill health
after an infection believe they have a physical illness).
Wessely (1994) references Sharpe et al.’s study as good
evidence that psycho-behavioural factors perpetuate CFS.
Here, minor correlations are used to support a dogmatic
CBM. One study with weak evidence is used to support
other studies with weak evidence. We identified numerous
examples of this practice across the CBM literature.

Discussion

The ‘cognitive behavioural model’ of ME/CFS is premised
on a theory that patients hold irrational and dysfunctional
beliefs/cognitions that influence behaviours and illness con-
tinuance. The CBM is a representational narrative model of
multiple constituent discrete parts that are said to have some
explanatory, predictive and therapeutic values. Essentially,
the CBM asserts that certain predisposing factors increase the
risk of developing ME/CFS, then a precipitating factor or
event, such as an infection, initiates the illness and later a host
of psycho-social factors are involved in maintenance of ME/
CFS. We find that this model narrative is contested by most
patients (Spandler and Allen, 2017) —a clear warning light. In
addition, research evidence continues to refute the model. We
outlined a range of inconsistencies and contradictions that
expose the CBM as weak and incoherent. For instance,
Surawy et al.’s (1995) or Harvey et al.’s (2008) diagrammatic
representations of the model offer no explanation of what spe-
cific pathogens trigger ME/CFS or how such infections cause
ME/CFS symptoms, other than to suggest the sufferer
wrongly attributes their symptoms to physical illness and
alters behaviours in response to this belief. The CBM fails to
explain why many ME/CFS sufferers experience muscle
pain, orthostatic intolerance and cognitive deficits. Overly
resting and somatising is an explanation offered by the CBM,
with little evidential support. It is noteworthy that the fear-
avoidance model of chronic pain has been criticised for lack
of empirical support (Wideman et al., 2013). Interestingly, in

--- Page 9 ---
Geraghty et al.

the field of neuro-psychiatry, depression is now linked to
neuro-inflammation (Miller et al., 2009) and neurological dis-
eases, such as multiple sclerosis, are also linked with viral
infections such as EBV (Pender et al., 2018).

There is a malign discourse within the CBM that implies
that patients no longer correctly interpret their bodily feel-
ings. The CBM treatment approach aims to coerce sufferers
into accepting an ‘alternative explanation’ for their symp-
toms (Abbey, 1993) that nothing is physically wrong and
that symptoms have no link to biological disease. This view
is discredited by international research that finds an array
of biological abnormalities in ME/CFS. Such research
strongly points to immune system changes and neurologi-
cal inflammation as being particularly salient (Komaroff
et al., 2018; Montoya et al., 2017; Tomas et al., 2017). ME/
CFS might now be considered a post-infectious neuro-
immune disease, with parallels to lupus or multiple sclero-
sis. Patients’ beliefs about their symptoms are well-founded
and logical.

Patients’ behavioural adaptations, such as resting as a
result of fatigue, weakness and pain, are exactly the type of
responses we might expect in chronic illness. The CBM
theory that ME/CFS is perpetuated by excessive rest is not
evidence-based and is contradicted by a linked CBM theory
that sufferers over-do things (in a boom-bust cycle). A more
rational explanation is that sufferers will continually test
their limits of ability and will adjust accordingly, while
attempting to revert to normal levels of activity. The stress,
anxiety and depression detected in ME/CFS patients is
likely related to a combination of brain and central nervous
system inflammation and physical distress (symptoms of
pain) and frustration at not being able to return to work or
social activities (social isolation). We also suggest that lack
of recognition of patients’ complaints by medical profes-
sionals adds to their distress (Blease et al., 2017).

Biological studies of ME/CFS may lead to new routes to
treatment that target biological abnormalities (Younger et al.,
2014), while the CBM continues to only support CBT and
GET as a treatment approach. We have shown above that the
success of these treatments is low and may be contaminated
by the inclusion of patients with non-ME/CFS in clinical tri-
als. Energy Envelope Theory suggests that ME/CFS suffer-
ers who expend more energy than they have available (go
outside of their limited energy envelope) experience greater
fatigue and impairment (Jason et al., 2013). Jason et al. sug-
gest careful pacing as an appropriate treatment approach in
ME/CES. Some researchers have had modest success using
pacing approaches (Pesek et al., 2000), showing that alterna-
tive approaches are able to produce modest benefits without
the need for belief modification.

One might assume that if the CBM accurately captures
the realities of ME/CFS with logic, reason and precision,
patient advocacy groups would support the model and asso-
ciated treatments; however, this is not the case. Patient
organisations are strongly opposed to CBT and GET as

treatments for ME/CFS. Wessely (1994) and others address
patients’ opposition to CBT-GET by suggesting that this is
an example of anti-psychiatry sentiment and the stigma of
mental health illness. However, Wood and Wessely (1999)
found no evidence to support this view in one study. In con-
trast, a review of patient survey evidence spanning 15 years
by Geraghty et al. found between 8 and 35 per cent of
patients report some benefit using CBT, while 65-92 per
cent report no benefit, and between 54 and 74 per cent
report graded exercise to be detrimental (Geraghty et al.,
2017). In a study by Deale and Wessely (2001), surveying
the views of 68 ME/CFS patients referred to their CFS
clinic, almost all patients expressed a view their illness had
a physical cause and over half also stated they had been
given a psychiatric explanation of their illness that was
‘unacceptable to them’. Clearly, patients are rejecting the
CBM and report little benefit using either CBT or GET.

There is growing concern that CBT and GET are not
benign medical interventions but are therapies that generate
arange of iatrogenic/harmful outcomes for ME/CFS suffer-
ers. The PACE trial found no significant evidence of seri-
ous adverse effects using CBT-GET to treat CFS (Dougall
et al., 2014). However, clinical trials such as PACE define
serious adverse events to include death, hospitalisations or
significant deterioration, while new symptoms are consid-
ered non-serious adverse events (White et al., 2007). In
contrast, a detailed review of harms by Kindlon (2011) sug-
gests that 20 per cent of patients with CFS report adverse
reactions to CBT. Geraghty and Blease (2016) highlight
how harms may be more nuanced in psychotherapy. For
example, if an ME/CFS patient fails to improve following
CBT, they may erroneously blame themselves for this fail-
ure, particularly if a CBT therapist postulates that success is
dependent on commitment to therapy. It is well documented
that clinical trials of psychotherapies often fail to investi-
gate adverse outcomes.

The CBM put forward by Wessely, Surawy, Sharpe,
Chalder, Moss-Morris and others represents their speculative
theories about ME/CFS pathogenesis and continuance. The
CBM might be considered an ‘idealized-narrative model’
that attempts to simplify complex observations. However, it
is rather obvious that all biological factors, sociological fac-
tors and psychological factors are not considered in this
model — all genetic or epigenetic factors for example. The
CBM appears to rest on an assumption (akin to the general
systems theory of von Bertalanffy) that everything interacts.
We see this eclectic grand theory in the BPS model of ME/
CFS using the 3Ps framework. However, Ghamei (2010)
articulates how such eclectic models suffer from being una-
ble to define ‘saliency’ — what is most important to under-
stand a disease. In the CBM, we find a narrow set of mainly
psychological factors studied and this small number of fac-
tors is said to validate the model. As we have shown in this
article, many of the factors proposed in the CBM are either
not evidence-based or have weak evidential support. In

addition, the role of biological dysfunction is all but ignored
within the CBM, relegated to a ‘trigger event’ — rather than a
major perpetuating factor. This is a fatal flaw of the CBM; it
sets itself up as a model to capture complexity (the bio-psy-
cho-social), but then rests on a subjective narrative of a small
number of factors (psycho), with limited explanation for
their interactions, while the existence of considerable contra-
dictory evidence is not addressed or ignored.

In contemporary logic, a model is a structure that makes
all sentences of a theory true (Hodges, 1997). The CBM is
one explanation of ME/CFS ~ it is a stylised description of
a relevant target system (Achinstein, 1968) along the lines
of Cartwright’s so-called ‘simulacrum account of explana-
tion’, which is a model to frame a theory of an explanation
sought (Frigg and Hartmann, 2006). The CBM is based
mostly on speculation. Far too much contradictory evi-
dence exists for the model to be held as credible. McLauren’s
(1998) paper on the flaws of the BPS model tackles the
issue of how flawed models misinform practice. We believe
the CBM proffers an inaccurate account of ME/CFS that
misinforms clinicians, therapists and patients. A model
should represent as closely as possible the subject illness
under investigation. Where it does not, or is easily
debunked, alternative models need to be explored. The
CBM of ME/CFS is fundamentally flawed and should be
abandoned as an explanatory-treatment model.

Conclusion

In this article, we reviewed the CBM of ME/CFS. This
model is often cited in the literature as a model to guide
clinical practice and treatment of this illness. We find this
model to be primarily an idealised narrative model. It
exists as a dogmatic model favoured by model promoters.
Our review exposes stark weaknesses, inconsistencies and
contradictions, both in its theoretical underpinnings and
the research said to prove model validity. Our findings
suggest the CBM is not fit for purpose, as it poorly reflects
the accounts given by patients and it ignores the wealth of
evidence showing biological, immune and neurological
dysfunction in ME/CFS. Given that the CBM is cited as
the basis for CBT and GET interventions, there is an
urgent need for clinicians, therapists and health providers
to review this treatment paradigm. Our findings help
explain why so many patients reject psychotherapy. An
alternative model should be formulated to better explain
the biological factors that predispose, precipitate and per-
petuate the illness. An explanatory model needs to closely
resemble illness pathogenesis and provide logic-driven
linkages between factors, including patients’ symptoms
and illness behaviours.

Abstract

Background: Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is a lifelong debilitating disease with a
complex pathology not yet clearly defined. Susceptibility to ME/CFS involves genetic predisposition and exposure to
environmental factors, suggesting an epigenetic association. Epigenetic studies with other ME/CFS cohorts have used
array-based technology to identify differentially methylated individual sites. Changes in RNA quantities and protein
abundance have been documented in our previous investigations with the same ME/CFS cohort used for this study.

Results: DNA from a well-characterised New Zealand cohort of 10 ME/CFS patients and 10 age-/sex-matched
healthy controls was isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear (PBMC) cells, and used to generate reduced
genome-scale DNA methylation maps using reduced representation bisulphite sequencing (RRBS). The sequencing
data were analysed utilising the DMAP analysis pipeline to identify differentially methylated fragments, and the Meth-
ylKit pipeline was used to quantify methylation differences at individual CpG sites. DMAP identified 76 differentially
methylated fragments and Methylkit identified 394 differentially methylated cytosines that included both hyper- and
hypo-methylation. Four clusters were identified where differentially methylated DNA fragments overlapped with

or were within close proximity to multiple differentially methylated individual cytosines. These clusters identified
regulatory regions for 17 protein encoding genes related to metabolic and immune activity. Analysis of differentially
methylated gene bodies (exons/introns) identified 122 unique genes. Comparison with other studies on PBMCs from
ME/CFS patients and controls with array technology showed 59% of the genes identified in this study were also found
in one or more of these studies. Functional pathway enrichment analysis identified 30 associated pathways. These
included immune, metabolic and neurological-related functions differentially regulated in ME/CFS patients compared
to the matched healthy controls.

Conclusions: Major differences were identified in the DNA methylation patterns of ME/CFS patients that clearly
distinguished them from the healthy controls. Over half found in gene bodies with RRBS in this study had been identi-
fied in other ME/CFS studies using the same cells but with array technology. Within the enriched functional immune,
metabolic and neurological pathways, a number of enriched neurotransmitter and neuropeptide reactome pathways
highlighted a disturbed neurological pathophysiology within the patient group.

been observed in Iceland [2]. Core symptoms include
severe fatigue, post-exertional malaise, and cognitive,
sleep and orthostatic dysfunctions as well as additional
debilitating symptoms that collectively are often severe
enough to leave patients house or bedbound. There is
enormous emotional, social and financial strain on the
affected individual and their families [3].

The acute phase of ME/CFS can be sustained long term
in ~ 25% of cases, but in the remaining ~ 75% the disease
progresses to a lifelong chronic phase that is generally
low functioning. A small percentage (~ 5%) may recover
although this subgroup may have originally been misdi-
agnosed [4]. Presentation of ME/CFS symptoms varies
among affected individuals and along each person's dis-
ease course, with regular periods of relapse and partial
recovery occurring over time. The disease presentation
and current research implicates multi-systemic dysfunc-
tion including: metabolic, neurological and immune/
inflammatory disruptions. Recent work has stressed the
role of the mitochondria in particular with a proposed
dysfunction resulting in an overall state of decreased
energy metabolism unable to compensate for stress
events [5]. The disease onset itself often follows a major
‘stress’ event, with a viral infection commonly reported
by patients. This has established the hypothesis that
onset of ME/CFS requires a stressor event coupled with a
normally ‘silent’ component of genetic risk [3].

A number of environmental factors such as exposure
to toxins/chemicals, stressful life events and especially
viral infections have been frequency reported in associa-
tion with the onset and progression of ME/CFS [3]. As
environmental factors such as these have been observed
to cause changes to an individuals DNA methylation,
this has prompted investigations into whether there are
specific epigenetic changes linked to the disease [6-10].
DNA methylation is the best understood epigenetic
modification where the addition of a methyl group to the
cytosine base of DNA is associated with changes in gene
expression without altering the genomic code itself [11].
This biological interface between an individual’s envi-
ronment and the regulation of their genome can provide
insights into an individual's disease activity.

A small number of studies [6-10] have utilised array-
based technology to interrogate DNA methylation in
ME/CFS patients at a large number of sites across the
genome. There are strengths in array-based genome
scale investigation since the targeted probes result in low
experimental variability, but they do have a restricted
CpG coverage as they are designed to target regions
that capture RefSeq genes and promoter CpG islands.
Reduced representation bisulphite sequencing (RRBS),
used in the current investigation, explores more CpG
regions across the genome, although the technology can

have greater technical variability, for example because
of ‘uneven read depths’ and ‘coverage of CpG regions’
among libraries [12, 13]. The array-based investigations
into ME/CFS [6-10] have identified a number of changes
with some similarities among the studies such as identifi-
cation of overrepresented functional pathways linked to
cell activity and immune functions. However, there are
also many variations within the approaches and analy-
ses, resulting in significant differences in outcomes from
these published studies.

A specific focus of a number of investigations into the
methylation status of ME/CFS has been on the potential
association between DNA methylation abnormalities and
the activity of the hypothalamic—pituitary—adrenal (HPA)
axis. The HPA axis is involved in a number of systems
maintaining circadian patterns, homeostatic regulations
and in an individual’s response to stress where environ-
mental cues stimulate the HPA system. This results in
the release of glucocorticoids such as cortisol producing
a corresponding response in a large number of systems
including: metabolism, immune, reproductive, nerv-
ous and cardiovascular systems. Studies have observed
irregular HPA activity in patients when exposed to chal-
lenges such as the Trier Social Stress test [14] and dexa-
methasone [8]. This supports the irregular activity of the
HPA axis as a basis for patients’ disproportional immune
response to stress. Key work supports an epigenetic ele-
ment with the identification of a number of differentially
methylated sites associated with glucocorticoid sensitiv-
ity in patients [8].

By investigating the epigenetic patterns distinct to ME/
CFS patients compared to matched controls, the overall
multi-systemic disruption caused by the disease can be
better understood. This study aimed to identify changes
in the PBMC DNA methylation of a New Zealand cohort
of ME/CFS patients. This included identification of dif-
ferentially methylated genes and regulatory regions
linked to functional pathways.

Results

Generating sequencing-based DNA methylome maps

for ME/CFS patients and age-matched healthy controls
Ten ME/CFS patients and ten age/sex matched controls
were investigated to identify patterns of DNA meth-
ylation specific to the disease state. PBMCs were puri-
fied from each subject and genomic DNA isolated for
library preparation for reduced representation bisul-
phite sequencing (RRBS). Following the sequencing,
the data were aligned to the human genome hg19 using
Bismark [15] and analyzed following two independ-
ent analysis approaches. The first was the utilisation
of DMAP [16, 17] with an ANOVA F test comparison
that identified changes in sequence data on 40-220 bp

Fig. 1 The study and analysis workflow for ME/CFS patients and age-matched healthy control methylome: DNA was isolated from the Peripheral
blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of 10 ME/CFS patients and 10 age/sex matched healthy controls. DNA was processed to produce reduced
representation bisulphite sequencing libraries. This DNA was then sequenced and the data aligned and trimmed using Bismark. The aligned
RRBS sequence data were then analyzed using two parallel analyses pipelines: DMAP and MethylKit. DMAP utilised an ANOVA F test comparing
patients and controls (requiring at least seven from each group to be present in each comparison between fragments). Associated promoter and
gene regions were then identified. Methylkit analysis pooled the patient and control groups before comparison using a Fisher's test to identify
differentially methylated cytosines (requiring at least seven from each group to be present in the comparison between cytosines). Promoter and
gene regions were then isolated and investigated

A previous RRBS study has indicated that using either
single CpG analysis or fragment-based methylation pat-
terns as an independent method was a valid way to
analyze the data [19]. We have analyzed our RRBS meth-
ylome here by both approaches to provide additional
technical validation to our study.

A summary of the sequencing data and Bismark align-
ment output is shown in Table 1. Most of the methyla-
tion occurs in CpGs with a range of 40-60% across the
cohort, and there was only a small percentage of non-
CpG methylation. For the patients and controls, the map-
ping efficiency was variable with about half the cohorts at
40% or above. The bisulphite conversion rate was calcu-
lated to be > 99%.

Fragment-based differential DNA methylation pattern

in ME/CFS patients:

Using DMAP analysis, 76 DNA fragments were identi-
fied as differentially methylated out of 146,575 analysed
RRBS fragments (with statistical thresholds set at a raw
P value <0.05 and a minimum methylation difference
of 15%). These were named as differentially methylated
fragments (DMFs). We have used a stringent P value
threshold without false discovery rate correction in order
to not lose true positives from this analysis, considering

Page 4 of 20

our sample size is low. The full list of DMFs is provided in
Additional file 1: Excel file ‘DMAP_Diff Fragments: The
76 DMFs averaged 70 bp in length. Of these DMFs, 52%
were hypo-methylated with 48% were hyper-methylated
in ME/CFS patients compared with the healthy controls.
The fragments were annotated and assigned to known
genomic regions of interest (as shown in Fig. 2a). The
major proportion of the DMFs were within intergenic
regions (43%) and in intronic regions of protein-coding
gene (27%) followed by gene promoters (16%) (defined as
500 bp downstream and 1500 bp upstream of the tran-
scription start site), and exonic regions of genes (14%).

Differential methylation pattern at single CpG sites in ME/
CFS patients

Using the MethylKit pipeline, 349 from a total of
196,172 individual CpG sites were identified as differ-
entially methylated CpGs (DMCs). They were deter-
mined to be statistically significant following a Fisher’s
exact test with a FDR adjusted P value (Q value) of
<0.05 and a minimum methylation difference of 15%
between the pooled control and patients’ samples (the
full list of DMCs is available in Additional file 1: Excel file
‘MethylKit_Diff_Cytosines’).

Each sample, as identified by sample ID, has corresponding data showing, total reads, mapping efficiency from bismark, methylated cytosines in three
different contexts (CpG, CpHpG and CpHpH). H can be either A, T or C, and the percentage is calculated individually for each context following the equation: %
methylation = 100 x methylated Cs/(methylated Cs + unmethylated Cs). The bisulphite conversion rate calculated as the average of the number of Ts (non-methylated

Cytosines) divided by coverage for each non-CpG cytosine

coloured segments, and hyper-methylated proportions by the lighter’shaded’ segments. '—'is hypo-methylated, and'+' is hyper-methylated. The

percentages in each segment are shown

Of the 349 DMCs, 56% were hypo-methylated and 44%
hyper-methylated in ME/CFS patients compared with
healthy controls. The sites were annotated to known
genomic regions including promoter, intronic, exonic
and intergenic regions (Fig. 2b). The highest proportion
of DMCs fell within intergenic regions of the genome
(40%) with the next largest falling within intronic regions
(25%), followed by promoters (23%) (defined as 500 bp
downstream and 1500 bp upstream of the transcription
start site) and exons (12%). The distribution of differen-
tial methylation across genomic locations from both the
MethylKit and DMAP analyses shows close concordance.
This gives additional confidence to the results produced
in the following analyses.

Clusters of differential methylation within regulatory

features identify mitochondrial and immune-related genes
To determine sites of differential methylation linked
to potential functional changes in ME/CFS, clusters
were identified using the differential methylation pro-
files produced by both DMAP and MethylKit pipelines
(see Fig. 3). Several overlapping clusters were identified
from the MethylKit and DMAP analyses, indicating their
importance within the genomic region at which they are
located. For example, 13 DMCs found by MethylKit anal-
ysis were also found in the same genomic location as 7
DMFs using DMAP. There were an additional 24 DMCs
identified from the Methylkit analysis in close proxim-
ity (<2 Kbp up or downstream) to another 7 DMFs. Four
clusters were identified with overlapping (Fig. 3b, c) or

close proximity DMFs and 4 or more DMCs (Fig. 3a, d).
Additional file 1: Excel file ‘Cluster_Data’ shows methyla-
tion scores at each cytosine and fragment within these
four clusters.

The length of the genome covered by the clusters var-
ied with the largest being 1570 bp and smallest 200 bp.
Investigation of these regions of the genome revealed
a number of regulatory features including enhancers,
DNase hypersensitivity regions and regions of Enhancer/
Gene regulatory associations recorded on the UCSC
genome browser database (see Fig. 3). These regions of
regulatory importance were associated with 17 protein-
encoding genes with various functions, with the major-
ity having strong links to mitochondrial function or the
immune system (or both) (see Table 2).

Figure 3 shows rolling average methylation scores
for the control and patients’ samples across DNA frag-
ment lengths as indicated from chromosomes 6, 11, 17
and 19. Larger points indicate sites of differential meth-
ylation with a FDR rate corrected Q value < 0.05. Smaller

Investigating differential methylation

within genomic features (gene bodies

and promoter regions)

Investigating the location of individual DMCs and
DMFs identified a number of genomic features of
interest. Figure 4 shows the individual patient and
control methylation values as individual points within
the box plots for the top five differentially methyl-
ated (A) fragments and (B) individual cytosines within

promoters and exon/intron genomic features. In the
case of the LOC339166 promoter region, several sites
were identified.

Differential methylation within promoter regions of genes

Promoter regions were defined as being 1500 bp
upstream and 500 bp downstream from the Transcrip-
tion Start Site (TSS). Of the identified differentially
methylated fragments (DMFs), 16% were found within
these defined promoter regions (see Fig. 2a), and half
were hypo-methylated and half hyper-methylated in ME/
CFS patients compared to controls. Eleven different pro-
moter regions were associated with twelve DMFs. The
LOC339166 associated promoter region contained two
adjacent statistically significant hypo-methylated frag-
ments. The genes linked to promoter regions associated
with the DMFs that show the most variation between the
patients and controls are shown in Table 3, with values
for both ME/CFS patients and healthy controls along
with the P and F test values.

The MethylKit analysis identified a larger number of
promoter-associated genes with 45 DMCs falling within
22 promoter regions. Of these individual cytosines, 69%
were hypo-methylated in ME/CFS patients compared

Annotation includes the ‘GeneHancer' ID of the associated differentially methylated enhancer, or the enhancer identified in the four clusters of differentially
methylated region of regulatory interaction. Also included is the chromosome in which the cluster was located along with a brief description of the gene function. All
are associated with hypo-methylated clusters except the rows highlighted italic that indicate association with a hyper-methylated cluster

to controls. There were two methylated promoter-asso-
ciated genes that overlapped between the DMAP and
MethylKit analyses, LOC339166 and NUDT14. The
region associated with LOC339166 encompasses the
cluster described previously within chromosome 17, and
identifies regulatory interactions for XAF1 and ZNF594.
NUDT14 is important for the elimination of toxic metab-
olites as well as the regulation of nucleotide substrates,
cofactors and signalling molecules.

The genes linked to promoter regions associated with
the top differentially methylated individual cytosines are
listed in Table 4, with values shown for ME/CFS patients
and healthy controls, along with their P and Q values.

Differential methylation within gene bodies

A significant proportion of the DMFs determined with
DMAP were located in intron and exon regions (26% and
14%, respectively—see Fig. 2). The DMAP fragment anal-
ysis identified 31 different genes within 31 fragments that
had a total of 190 CpGs within them. The gene GNG7 was
associated with the fragment that had the most statisti-
cally significant differentially methylated CpGs. GNG7 is
a guanine nucleotide-binding protein with a large range
of functions including the regulation of adenylyl cyclase
in the brain. Information concerning the length of the

ment, and patient, control and differential methylation

Validation of RRBS methylomes of ME/CFS patients

with independent cohorts from published array based
methylome studies

Till date, five published studies have compared the meth-
ylation states of cohorts of ME/CFS patients compared
with healthy matched controls [6-10]. All these studies

have utilised array-based methods with either the Infin-
ium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip [6-8, 10] or the
Illumina Methylation EPIC microarray [9]. The array-
based platforms by design covers less number of CpG
sites. Our study, utilising reduced representation bisul-
phite sequencing (RRBS), is the first study with ME/CFS
patients to use this method—has identified differential
methylation across the genome in regions enriched with
functional CpG sites. Extensive validation of this method
and the analytical platforms has been carried out previ-
ously by our group and others [19-21], and RRBS was
also used to generate reproducible methylomes in mul-
tiple organisms as well (human, mouse, zebrafish) [22-
24]. While the two methods produce very different raw

Fig. 5b, of the 122 genes identified by the two analysis
platforms in our study, 42 were identified in all 3 studies
(A+B -+ New Zealand), 21 in only Trivedi et al. 2018 and
our study (A+ New Zealand), and 9 only de Vega et al.
2017 and our study (B+New Zealand). Hence 72/122
genes identified in our study have been identified in the
two studies with significant overlap. Genes (13/14) over-
lapping with the smaller de Vega et al. 2014 study were
also found in the other two studies (that is all 4 studies),
and (1/14) with the Trivedi et al. 2018 study only (that is,
in 3 studies). These results strongly validates our RRBS
results with an independent platform and cohorts.

Do identified differentially methylated DNA fragments

and differentially methylated individual cytosines relate

to ME/CFS pathophysiology?

To determine whether the genomic elements associated
with the DMFs and individual DMCs were identifying
systemic changes relevant to ME/CFS pathophysiology,
a functional enrichment analysis was performed through
STRING.org v.11.0 [25]. No significant enriched func-
tional pathways were identified based on the differentially
methylated promoter-associated genes through either the
DMAP or MethylKit analysis.

Functional analysis was performed on the 31 genes
associated with DMFs identified in the DMAP analysis
and the 91 genes associated with the DMC analysis. Both
STRING analyses were performed with the FDR P value
cut-off of<0.05. The enrichment analysis on the gene
bodies associated with hyper- and hypo-methylated frag-
ments identified in the DMAP analysis revealed a total of
22 functional pathways, 21 associated with hypo-methyl-
ated gene bodies and 1 associated with hyper-methylated
gene bodies (Fig. 6a). From the 31 genes in the analysis,

Discussion

The first study with reduced representation bisulphite
sequencing

This is the first study of its kind to explore the reduced
DNA methylome of ME/CFS patient PBMCs utilising
reduced representation bisulphite sequencing (RRBS).
This approach has identified a number of differentially
methylated genomic features through multiple statistical
analyses. These features were associated with a number
of specific functions as well as enriched functional path-
ways. The data indicated an imprint of a systemic dis-
ruption revealed in the changed methylome of ME/CFS
patients, particularly implicating immune, energy metab-
olism and neurological disruptions.

Since its first use in 2005, RRBS has been utilised by a
number of international research groups producing relia-
ble and reproducible results in a number of large and var-
ied investigations across different tissue types and species
[26-28]. The reliability of RRBS is strongly supported by
work performed utilising the same RRBS platform as in

this analysis that has been well validated in prior inves-
tigations [20, 21]. Chatterjee et al. 2016 demonstrated
that the platform used for this investigation is highly reli-
able with replicate RRBS library preparations sequenced
on different flow cells producing very consistent outputs
(Pearson’s correlation coefficient of 0.98) [20]. The RRBS
platform has also been validated through additional work
performed previously [21]. The reliability of RRBS-based
data was validated against other small-scale sequencing
platforms through comparison with the Sequenom Epi-
Typer platform. A correlation (Pearson’s correlation coef-
ficient) of 0.98 was observed when fragment methylation
values were compared across four genes [21]. This pro-
vides confidence in the reliability of the technical validity
of the method and the results of the current study.

Multiple statistical approaches were taken in order to
detect as many meaningful changes as possible. In order
to detect broad changes in DNA methylation likely linked
to functional changes, the fragment-based DMAP analy-
sis was utilised. To both support and build upon this ini-
tial approach, individual cytosine methylation was also
interrogated utilising MethylKit. As would be expected
both showed similar overall distributions of differen-
tial methylation (Fig. 2) in addition to a small number of
shared features identified in the most differentially meth-
ylated DMFs and individual cytosines. However, there
were also many differences in the outputs between the
two analyses of the promoter region and of the gene bod-
ies (exons/introns), and consequent enrichment analy-
sis highlighting the divergence of results that can occur
when utilising different statistical approaches.

This is especially relevant for making comparisons
among the studies that have investigated DNA methyla-
tion changes in ME/CFS cohorts where varying results
were obtained [6-10]. Among them there are differ-
ences in study design with consideration of (1) clini-
cal case definition used for diagnosis, (2) methodology,
(3) study population and (4) statistical analysis. Table 7
summarises the design variations and outputs in the
published work and our study. There are differences in
both study designs and analysis strategies in the studies
that utilised array-based platforms. The variations seen
in the tissue type utilised, cohort designs and particu-
larly the differences in the statistical thresholds set in
the analyses have, not surprisingly, produced variation
in the outcomes. This is seen in the number of statisti-
cally significant differentially methylated sites observed
by each study and the surprisingly wide divergence even
in the overall proportions of hypo- and hyper- methyla-
tion (Table 7). Two studies report almost exclusively
hypo-methylation changes [6, 9], while the other three
predominately hyper-methylated changes [7, 8, 10].
In our NZ study, there was a more even distribution

Page 13 of 20

between hypo-methylated, and hyper-methylated sites,
but with differentially methylated cytosines within the
promoter regions predominantly hypo-methylated
(~ 70%) and, as discussed below, the majority of the
functional pathways identified were due to the presence
of five hypo-methylated genes.

The NZ study used the Canadian Consensus Criteria
[29] for diagnosis, while the other studies used patients
diagnosed by this criteria and the earlier 1994 Fukuda
diagnostic criteria [30] developed by the Centre for
Disease Control in the USA. While this has been most
commonly used by researchers and clinicians [31], it
does not include the core defining symptoms of post-
exertional malaise and neurocognitive disturbances,
nor does it exclude patients whose symptoms may
originate from a psychiatric disorder. The Canadian
Consensus Criteria (CCC) [29] was developed in 2003
by an international ME/CFS expert group, highlighting
post-exertional malaise as a core symptom, along with
fatigue, sleep dysfunction and pain. Additionally, neu-
rological/cognitive and autonomic/neuroendocrine/
immune symptom groups were included. The NZ study
like Herrera et al. [10] and Brenu et al. [6] had both
male and female subjects, while the other studies were
exclusively female. The statistical thresholds set for the
analyses can result in variations among the published
studies in the identification of differentially methylated
sites, for example, utilising uncorrected P values < 0.001
[6] compared to the more stringent FDR corrected P
values < 0.05 [7-9] that remove potential false positives
from the data. Another important distinction is the
variation in the threshold set for ‘significant’ methyla-
tion differences across the studies. The previous stud-
ies utilised array-based technologies, so methylation
differences were calculated as beta differences, i.e. the
ratio of probe intensity over total intensity used as an
estimate of methylation percentage at each probe. The
‘significant methylation differences’ required between
the patient and control groups varied across the studies
from a methylation ( value) fold change > 2.0 [6] to a
beta difference of >0.2 [7] and>0.05 [8-9]. This means
the number of statistically significant differentially
methylated sites identified by each of these studies and
the present study would be expected to be different
according to the different statistical criteria set to iden-
tify significant changes between the ME/CFS patients
and controls (see Table 7).

[6], B=de Vega et al. 2014 [7], C=de Vega et al. 2017 [8], D = Trivedi et al. 2018 [9], E=Herrera et al. 2018 [10]) The table includes the cell type utilised, the method
used in the analysis, the numbers and gender included in the cohort, diagnostic criteria of the patients and the statistical thresholds utilised in the analyses. *D
(Trivedi et al. [9]) included a larger cohort for pyrosequencing validation with a total of 33 cases and 31 controls from three geographical locations

New Zealand study using RRBS. This revealed that 59%
(72/122) of the genes identified in the New Zealand
study had been observed in one or more of the previ-
ous studies, with 34% (42/122) observed in two com-
parable studies using PBMCs [8-9]. This indicates that
even with ME/CFS cohorts diagnosed by different cri-
teria and differing in age range, gender, stage of illness,
nationality, and with significant variations in inves-
tigative processes, it has been possible to detect spe-
cific ME/CFS differential methylation compared with
healthy controls. Interestingly, the two studies utilising
sub populations of T cells showed only small overlaps
in the genes showing differential methylation suggest-
ing the changes are specific to the particular physiolog-
ical functions of those cells in the ME/CFS illness.

DNA methylation changes in the regulatory regions

of genes

As DNA methylation within the regulatory regions of
genes has been known to negatively correlate with gene
expression, identification of differential methylation
within these regions in our study has potential func-
tional implications for ME/CFS patients compared to
healthy controls. Four clusters of differential methylation,
identified using both DMAP and MethylKit data, were
observed across regions of the genome with a number of
regulatory interactions. Two primary functional group-
ings, mitochondrial and immune, were observed across
the genes associated with these differentially methylated
regulatory regions, supporting an association between

--- Page 15 ---
Helliwell et al. Clin Epigenet (2020) 12:167

the observed differential methylation patterns and the
pathophysiology of ME/CFS.

Clusters of differential methylation in the regulatory
regions of genes UCP2, LONP1 and NDUFA11I related
to mitochondrial function identified in this study sug-
gest impaired functioning. UCP2 is an uncoupling pro-
tein capable of dissipating the proton gradient generated
by NADH-powered pumping of protons into the inter-
membrane space with associated links to energy metabo-
lism efficiency [32]. It has been positively associated with
reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reduces their genera-
tion making it important for cellular protection. As the
enhancer for this gene was hyper-methylated, it indi-
cates ME/CFS patients may exist in a state of impaired
energy metabolism in addition to being more vulner-
able to ROS. Additionally, LONP1 is a stress-associated
protein involved in the maintenance and function of
the mitochondria by removing oxidised proteins from
the mitochondrial matrix. Increased levels are associ-
ated with acute stress [33]. As the enhancer region was
hypo-methylated, it is likely that ME/CFS patients have
an overexpression of LONP1 compared to healthy con-
trols providing an explanation why they exist in an
irregular state of acute stress, well documented clini-
cally. NDUFA11 is a subunit of the membrane bound
mitochondrial complex 1 (NADH dehydrogenase) [34]
and with the enhancer region hypo-methylated in ME/
CFS patients an associated increase in expression may be
indicative of a compensatory response to an overall mito-
chondrial dysfunction, as has been suggested by Missai-
lidis et al. [5].

Mitochondrial function and energy metabolism
have previously been shown to be impaired in other
approaches in ME/CFS patients and, while specific find-
ings from study to study are inconsistent [35-38]. Previ-
ous work from our research group on the NZ cohort of
ME/CFS patients characterised the PBMC transcriptome
[39] identifying a significant increase in expression of a
component of the first enzyme complex in the electron
transport chain—NDUFS6, also a subunit of the NADH
dehydrogenase. Additionally, to gain further insight into
the pathophysiology of ME/CFS, we have very recently
assessed the proteomes of PBMCs by SWATH-MS anal-
ysis in our small well-characterised group of patients
and matched controls [40]. A total of 60 proteins in the
ME/CFS patients were differentially expressed (P<0.01,
Logl0 (Fold Change)>0.2 and<—0.2). A proportion
of the identified proteins in the ME/CFS groups were
involved in mitochondrial function, oxidative phospho-
rylation, electron transport chain complexes, and redox
regulation. A significant number were also involved
in previously implicated disturbances in ME/CFS,
such as the immune and inflammatory response, DNA

Page 15 of 20

methylation, apoptosis and proteasome activation [40].
The results from this study also support a model of defi-
cient ATP production in ME/CFS, compensated for by
upregulation of pathways immediately upstream of Com-
plex V that would suggest an elevation of oxidative stress.
Missailidis et al. [5] concluded the activity of mitochon-
drial complex V involved in the actual synthesis of ATP
is impaired resulting in up-regulation of remaining com-
plexes and in particular complex 1 resulting in an inabil-
ity to compensate for energy need during activity and
stress. A predicted increase in the expression of the first
mitochondrial electron chain complex in this epigenetic
study and our previous studies and that of Missailidis
et al. implicates an attempt to compensate for impaired
energy production in these cohorts of ME/CFS patients.

The observed differential methylation in regulatory
regions of genes associated with immune and inflam-
matory responses is not unexpected due the known
pathophysiology of ME/CFS. Prior work has identified
abnormalities in cytokine profiles [41] with additional
supporting work indicating abnormal T lymphocyte acti-
vation and impaired cytotoxic responses [42]. The com-
bination of these observations and the prolonged flu-like
symptoms of ME/CFS indicates that an immune impair-
ment is a key component of the disease. Nine genes asso-
ciated with clusters of differential methylation identified
in this study have roles with links to immune function
and inflammation such as the gene product IRF4; an
interferon regulatory factor important for the protection
of the cell from viral infection through the activation of
immune responses. EXOC2 is also involved in immune
responses against viral infection through the co-locali-
sation with STING and subsequent stimulation of inter-
feron genes [43]. The hypo-methylation of the IRF4 and
EXOC2 associated enhancer regions in ME/CFS patients
indicates a potential up-regulation of their associated
proteins. As increased interferon presence in patients has
already been hypothesised to contribute to the prolonged
fatigue [44], this up-regulation of the interferon response
may reflect symptoms of fever, muscle pain and flu-like
symptoms found in ME/CFS patients.

A number of the previous investigations into the meth-
ylome of ME/CFS patients have highlighted immune
activity as being potentially dysfunctional based on the
outcomes of their analyses [6—7, 9]. Earlier work identi-
fied the immune KEGG pathway ‘Antigen processing and
presentation’ [6] as being significantly enriched through
the genes associated with differentially methylated
probes, and another study identified an over-representa-
tion of GO terms related to immune cell regulation [7]
indicating widespread irregular immune activity. Addi-
tional research identified gene pathway enrichment of a
number of immune-regulatory stress response pathways

--- Page 16 ---
Helliwell et al. Clin Epigenet (2020) 12:167

including the p38 MAPK pathway which is involved in
the response to inflammatory cytokines. Furthermore,
they also identified a number of enriched interleukin sig-
nalling pathways including IL-8 [9]. IL8 had been iden-
tified as the gene with the most enhanced expression in
our transcriptome analysis on the NZ cohort in ME/CFS
atients compared to controls [39].

DNA methylation within gene bodies (exons/introns)
as also been associated with changes in gene expres-
sion with hyper-methylation of the first exon often asso-
ciated with an inverse correlation with gene expression
(11). However, internal intron and exon methylation
as also been observed with a positive correlation with
gene expression (45). In order to explore the systematic
changes in expression, pathway enrichment analysis of
the genes associated with differential methylation was
erformed and identified a large number of functional
athways with links to the known clinical presentation of
ME/CFS.

The KEGG pathway ‘Circadian entrainment’ was iden-
tified in this analysis through genes associated with hypo-
methylation within internal introns. This is potentially
indicative of an irregular circadian rhythm being estab-
lished in ME/CFS patients vs. healthy controls, especially
with the hypo-methylated ryanodine receptor RYR1 hav-
ing an important role setting the clock to the evening
phase in response to light [46]. Our previous transcrip-
tome study performed on the same NZ cohort of patients
observed changes in the expression of genes encoding
circadian rhythm-related proteins, indicating a disrup-
tion to circadian regulation [38]. The correlations across
these biological investigations with patient symptoms are
providing a significant crossover with the overall clinical
presentation of ME/CFS, with symptoms such as fatigue,
sleep and cognitive dysfunctions, flu-like symptoms and
metabolic and immune disruptions all having links to
disrupted circadian activity.

The majority of the functional pathways identified were
due to the presence of five /ypo-methylated genes (inter-
nal intron); RYRI, GNAS, GNG7, GABRB3 and APBA2,
which in various combinations identified 22 enriched
functional pathways in the analysis. It is interesting to
note that the gene bodies of RYR1, GNG7, GNAS and
APBA2 have been associated with differentially methyl-
ated probes in multiple previous publications (for exam-
ple 8, 9) (see Additional file 1: Excel file ‘Gene_Overlaps’)
described in the results section. RYRI is a ryanodine
receptor that acts as a calcium release channel within
skeletal muscle. It is also involved in the establishment
of circadian rhythms as it is known to release calcium in
response to light, synchronising the internal biological
clock—the suprachiasmatic nucleus [46]. Both GNAS and
GNG7 are guanine nucleotide-binding protein subunits

important for the activity of transmembrane signal-
ling systems in particular the adenylyl cyclase signalling
activity and subsequently cAMP [47, 48]. GABRB3 is a
receptor for gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and is
therefore plays an important role in the function of the
inhibitory neurotransmitter (GABA) within the central
nervous system [49] APBA2 is a neuronal adaptor protein
essential for neurotransmitter release [50]. These specific
functions provide strong validation to the biological rel-
evance of the observations here highlighting the impor-
tance of the functional pathways to the pathophysiology
of ME/CFS. Of these pathways, a large number were neu-
rotransmitter and neuropeptide-related KEGG Pathways
including; Serotonergic, Glutamatergic, GABAergic,
Oxytocin, Dopaminergic, Apelin and Relaxin signal-
ling. Neurotransmitter activity such as that of 5-meth-
oxytryptamine (5-MT) (a compound critical to serotonin
and melatonin metabolism) and neurotransmitter metab-
olites has been correlated with ME/CFS symptom sever-
ity previously indicating that these overrepresented
pathways are potentially informative of ME/CFS patho-
physiology [51]. Neurotransmitters themselves have been
hypothesised to play a role in the symptom presentation
of ME/CFS with excess levels of serotonin known to have
impacts on an individual’s cognition, neuromuscular
activity and autonomic system [52].

Together the combination of neurotransmitter func-
tional pathways identified in this analysis provides a
compelling addition to the hypothesis indicating that
a dysfunctional HPA axis of ME/CFS patients is at least
in part responsible for their prolonged disease state [53].
Many previous studies have focused on the link between
epigenetic irregularities and the HPA axis activity in ME/
CFS pathophysiology with the most compelling outcome
the identification of 13 differentially methylated sites
associated with glucocorticoid hypersensitivity in ME/
CFS patients [8]. The HPA axis is stimulated by the para-
ventricular nucleus (PVN) within it. This structure con-
tains a cluster of neurons regulating stress responses, and
it is hypothesised to be a critical core centre for the ME/
CFS condition, supporting prolonged and _ fluctuating
disease [54]. The PVN is regulated itself by a number of
neurotransmitters including those identified in this work
such as apelin, serotonin, glutamate, GABA, endocan-
nabinoids and dopamine. Figure 7 presents a summary of
the HPA axis, and how our study of the predicted overex-
pressed neurotransmitters shown in the figure can invoke
a stress response affecting many important physiological
systems in ME/CFS.

The HPA axis is involved in a variety of functions from
circadian regulation to the stimulation of stress responses
to external stimuli. It impacts on cardiovascular, repro-
ductive, metabolic, immune and nervous systems, and

Fig. 7 The HPA axis including the overrepresented neurotransmitter pathways in ME/CFS identified by this analysis. The pathways identified from
the overrepresentation analysis and shown here are known to stimulate the HPA axis either directly through the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) with
corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH)-producing cells or by an unknown mechanism linked to it. The activation of the CRH sensitive neuronal
cells then triggers a downstream stimulation of the anterior pituitary causing the release of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). ACTH stimulates
the adrenal cortex releasing glucocorticoids including cortisol into the body. Cortisol then has a role in the stimulation of a large number of

downstream systems involved in a stress response

its dysfunction is connected to the clinical presentation
of ME/CFS providing a compelling yet broad target for
further research.

Our study demonstrates how DNA methylation has
provided an imprint of multiple systemic changes in ME/
CFS with links to disease pathophysiology. Comparisons
with previous relevant publications have provided com-
pelling support that the genes identified in this work are
reflecting changes specific to an ME/CFS state. Many
of the specific targets highlighted can now become the
focus of validation and stimulation of further work to
ameliorate the devastating effects of ME/CFS on those
affected by the disease.

Methods

Cohort recruitment

ME/CFS patients and controls were recruited from
Dunedin NZ. Diagnosis of ME/CFS was made by Dr
Rosamund Vallings of the Howick Health and Medi-
cal Centre, Auckland, NZ, using the Canadian consen-
sus diagnostic criteria [29]. Patients and controls were
age- and sex-matched. Patients completed a question-
naire at the onset of this study, a blank copy of which is
included as Additional file 3: Word document: ‘Ques-
tionnaire: They ranged in age from 9 to 80 and included
both males and females, with an illness duration aver-
aging 12.5 years. Seven of the ten patients had a sudden

onset with the remaining three reporting either a period
of 1-12 months to over 12 months for onset. All patients
report a loss of normal function with the majority either
housebound or with limited activity and unable to work.
Only two patients are able to work in any capacity (part
time). Patients included in the cohort reported frequent
suffering of symptoms, in particular; ‘persistent fatigue;
‘exhaustion from physical or mental activity, ‘physical/
mental activity resulting in worsening of symptoms,
‘intolerance to stress’ and notably ‘recovery after activ-
ity taking longer after their ME/CFS onset: The major-
ity of patients reported to be affected either ‘severely’
or ‘very severely’ for these symptoms. Additional details
of the cohort can be found in Additional file 1: Excel file
‘Patient_Background’ and ‘Symptom_Presentation, and
Additional file 2: Figure $1. The study conforms to the
ethics approval 17/STH/188 for ME/CFS patient studies,
from the Southern Health and Disability Ethics Commit-
tee of New Zealand. General consultation with the Ngai
Tahu Research Committee of the University of Otago was
carried out before the beginning of this research.

PBMC isolation

Patients filled out a small survey detailing their current
condition at the time of blood collection. Blood fractions
were processed within on the same day. PBMCs were iso-
lated from the whole blood by layering on Ficoll-Paque
before separating plasma from PMBCs and other cells
by centrifuging at 400xg. The PBMC layer was pelleted
(100xg) through PBS and the resulting pellet resus-
pended in PBS and RNA later and stored at — 80 °C.

DNA extraction

DNA was extracted from 200 uL of the PBMC fraction
using the Illustra blood Genomic Prep Mini Spin Kit
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. DNA was
eluted in the kit’s EB buffer. Concentration was deter-
mined utilising the Qubit 2.0 fluorometer, following the
Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit protocol [50].

Reduced representation bisulphite sequencing

RRBS libraries were prepared as previously described
[55-58]. Briefly, genomic DNA (500 ug) was digested
with 160 units MSP1 restriction enzyme. Following end
repair and adenylation of 3’ ends, adaptors were ligated
to the DNA fragments. Bisulphite conversion was per-
formed using the specifications of the EZ DNA methyla-
tion Kit. Semi-quantitative PCR was performed on the
bisulphite converted DNA in order to determine the opti-
mal amplification cycle needed for the final large scale
PCR of the overall library. Following PCR amplification
of the DNA, it was size-selected using a 6%(w/v) NuSieve
Gel in order to extract the desired size (40-220 bp) for

Page 18 of 20

the RRBS libraries and to minimise adaptor contamina-
tion. Following purification and analysis of quality using
a BioAnalyzer and Qubit measures, samples were further
purified using AMPure XP Bead purification.

DNA sequencing

The majority of the samples were sequenced through Cus-
tom Science; however, C012 and ME016 were sequenced
through the Otago Genomics and Bioinformatics Facility.
Following sequencing, the raw fastq files were checked for
adaptor presence and trimmed. The data were aligned to
the human genome version GRCh37/hg19 using Bismark
bowtie alignment generating BAM files utilised in the dif-
ferential methylation analysis.

Statistical analyses

Analyses were performed in two parts, first using the
DMAP analysis program run on a MAC OS X com-
puter in order to investigate changes across fragments
40-220 bp in length and then in R Studio using the
MethylKit package to investigate changes in methylation
on a single cytosine basis.

DMAP used an ANOVA F test comparison between
the patient and the control groups. A minimum of seven
individuals per group had to have data for the fragment
being compared to be included in the criteria. A raw P
value threshold<0.05 was established. The genomic
features overlapping with the features were identified
using the DMAP inbuilt Geneloc function and then with
GenomicRanges with promoter overlaps (sourced from
TxDb hg19 genomic data).

MethylKit performed a Fisher’s test on the pooled
patient and control groups (with a minimum of seven
individuals having methylation records at each cytosine
in order for it to be included). A FDR-corrected P value
threshold of< 0.05 was established. The genomic features
overlapping with differential methylation were deter-
mined using TxDb hg19 genomic annotation data.

function of both the signal and noise.

Background: |llumina’s HumanMethylation450 arrays provide the most cost-effective means of high-throughput
DNA methylation analysis. As with other types of microarray platforms, technical artifacts are a concern, including
background fluorescence, dye-bias from the use of two color channels, bias caused by type I/Il probe design, and
batch effects. Several approaches and pipelines have been developed, either targeting a single issue or designed to
address multiple biases through a combination of methods. We evaluate the effect of combining separate

Results: In this study nine processing methods, including both within- and between- array methods, are applied
and compared in four datasets. For technical replicates, we found both within- and between-array methods did a
comparable job in reducing variance across replicates. For evaluating biological differences, within-array processing
always improved differential DNA methylation signal detection over no processing, and always benefitted from
performing background correction first. Combinations of within-array procedures were always among the best
performing methods, with a slight advantage appearing for the between-array method Funnorm when batch
effects explained more variation in the data than the methylation alterations between cases and controls. However,
when this occurred, RUVm, a new batch correction method noticeably improved reproducibility of differential
methylation results over any of the signal-processing methods alone.

Conclusions: The comparisons in our study provide valuable insights in preprocessing HumanMethylation450
BeadChip data. We found the within-array combination of Noob + BMIQ always improved signal sensitivity, and
when combined with the RUVm batch-correction method, outperformed all other approaches in performing
differential DNA methylation analysis. The effect of the data processing method, in any given data set, was a

and disease states. For instance in cancers, alterations in
DNA methylation landscapes include a global hypome-
thylation of the genome accompanied with CpG island
hypermethylation [1]. DNA methylation alterations are
also described for other types of diseases, such as

neurological and autoimmune diseases, and other disor-
ders such as cardiovascular diseases, metabolic diseases
and myopathies [2]. Furthermore, epidemiological studies
have revealed associations between DNA methylation and
exposures such as prenatal maternal smoking [3] and
environmental chemicals [4]. The Illumina Infinium
HumanMethylation450 (HM450) BeadChip is a popular
technology for large-scale DNA methylation profiling due
to its advantage in reagent cost and time, comprehensive
coverage and high throughput.

Along with the widespread application of the HM450
array, a number of statistical approaches have arisen to ad-
dress technical noise in the estimate of DNA methylation
level. For a targeted cytosine, probes bind to methylated
and unmethylated alleles and emit a fluorescence signal.

The DNA methylation level, called Beta value, is estimated
by the ratio of the methylated to the sum of methylated
and unmethylated intensities. Issues encountered during
probe design resulted in the implementation of two types
of chemical assays, Infinium I and Infinium II, with differ-
ent technical characteristics. The Infinium type I design
utilizes two probes in the same color channel to quantify
methylated and unmethylated alleles, the color channel
determined by the nucleotide 5’ to the target cytosine
(green for G/C and red for A/T); type I probes are more
likely to target CpG-dense regions and in the body of the
probes all CpGs are assumed to have the same methyla-
tion state as the target site. In contrast, the Infinium type
II design utilizes one probe but two color channels for a
single cytosine target, with green and red channel measur-
ing methylated and unmethylated alleles, respectively; type
II probes contain a degenerate base at the cytosine pos-
ition for CpGs in the probe body. Technical noise is intro-
duced by the variation in background fluorescence signal
across arrays and color channel and the different average
intensities in the red and green channels. Together, these
can introduce additive and multiplicative errors to the sig-
nal intensity, reducing the dynamic range of the Beta value
and skewing the values of Infinium II Beta values differen-
tially across samples. Other studies showed type II Beta
values have lower dynamic range than type I Beta values
(5, 6] and that technical variation potentially varies by
position on the chip (12 samples/BeadChip), and process-
ing time or place.

Given the increasing popularity of the HM450 array
and the biases observed due to platform design, several
approaches and pipelines have been developed, either
targeting a single issue or designed to address multiple
biases within a complete framework. Recently, some
systematic comparisons of preprocessing procedures
ave appeared [7-10], however, evaluations of combin-
ation approaches are less common [11, 12]. Pidsley et al.
13] evaluated the combining of methods with different
mechanisms together. However, improved approaches
ave since appeared and are worthy of further consider-
ation. Of interest is (1) the overall best approach for signal
rocessing; (2) the performance of recent between-array
methods when analyzing data with substantial biological
eterogeneity; and (3) the efficacy of processing ap-
roaches when DNA methylation differences are subtler
than the stark changes observed in tumorigenesis or aging.
In this study nine processing methods are applied and
compared in four datasets. The methods include both
between-array and within-array normalization methods,
as well as combination approaches that sequentially
apply procedures addressing different platform biases.
The datasets range from cancer data to Alzheimer’s
brain data, showing distinctly different variation in
DNA methylation. The methods are evaluated based on

Page 2 of 11

their ability to reduce technical variance, as well as to
identify reproducible differential methylation positions
(DMPs) in case-control studies. We show that the per-
formance of processing methods will depend on the na-
ture of the datasets, and, in general, within-array
processing for background and probe design bias per-
forms well in all datasets. Furthermore, we reveal that
the within-array methods appear robust to obtaining
reproducible results across different types of data sets.
This should be especially meaningful when dealing with
clinical research data where we have only one sample
per group. Finally, between-array normalization helps
when the variation due to noise is greater than the vari-
ation due to biological signal; however, when the methyla-
tion alterations are substantial in size and number some
between-array methods might remove biological signal.

Methods

Preprocessing methods

In total we evaluate and compare nine preprocessing
approaches based on the following within-array and be-
tween-array methods: (1) background correction and
dye-bias equalization (Noob) [14]; (2) beta-mixture
quantile normalization (BMIQ) [6]; (3) subset-quantile
within-array normalization (SWAN) [15]; (4) background
adjustment followed by between-array normalization per-
formed separately by probe design (Dasen) [13]; (5)
subset-quantile normalization (SQN) [11, 16]; and (6)
functional normalization (Funnorm) [17]. All analyses are
implemented in R version 3.0.3, Bioconductor version
2.12 [18] with functions Noob, SWAN, SQN and Fun-
norm implemented in the minfi package (version 1.6.0)
[16], and Dasen and BMIQ in wateRmelon (version 1.0.3)
[13]. In addition to these published methods, we also
combine methods that correct for different biases: (1)
Noob + BMIQ; (2) Noob + SWAN; (3) Funnorm + BMIQ.
We note that the function Funnorm already includes
Noob as a first step.

Briefly, Noob performs within-array normalization
correcting for background fluorescence and dye bias. It
fits a normal-exponential convolution model to estimate
the true signal conditional on the observed intensities,
capitalizing on the unique design of the Infinium I probe
pairs to estimate non-specific signal from the ‘out-of-
band’ intensities, the wavelength in the opposite color
channel to their design (1 = 92,596 for Cy3 features and
n=178,406 for Cy5 features). These background-
corrected intensities are then normalized for variation in
average intensity in the red and green channel via a
multiplicative scale factor computed using the average
intensities of the positive control probes.

BMIQ is a mixture-model-based normalization method
designed to correct the type II probe bias and make the
methylation distribution of type II features comparable to

--- Page 3 ---
Liu and Siegmund BMC Genomics (2016) 17:469

the distribution of type I features. BMIQ fits a three-state
(unmethylated, 50 % methylated and fully methylated)
beta mixture model for the type I and type II probes sep-
arately, with probes assigned to the state with maximum
probability. Beta values for the type II features are normal-
ized by state to the distributions of the same estimated in
type I features. Like Noob, it is a within-array method.

SWAN is also a within-array normalization method
for probe type design, but unlike BMIQ, it starts from
methylated and unmethylated intensities. SWAN is based
on the assumption that probes with the same number of
CpGs in the probe body should have similar intensity
distributions (since the regions they interrogate should
have similar biological features). For the methylated and
unmethylated intensities separately, a random subset of
type I and II probes matched on underlying CpG number
are selected and quantile normalized. The intensities of
the remaining probes are adjusted by linear interpolation.
Consequently, the intensity distributions between two
probe types are identical in each subset, while the differ-
ence in overall distributions between two probe types still
remains.

In contrast to the first three methods, the Dasen
method is a between-sample normalization method,
and like Noob and SWAN, it adjusts the raw intensities
instead of Beta values. The background of type I probes
is adjusted to match that of the type II and standard quan-
tile normalization applied to methylated and unmethy-
lated intensities separately by probe type (I or II).

SQN is another between-sample normalization method
for methylated and unmethylated intensities that also
involves within-sample normalization of type I and II
probes. Type II intensities are normalized across arrays,
and within arrays, type I intensities are normalized to the
type II distributions within four feature subsets (CpG is-
land, CpG island shore, CpG island shelf, and Open Sea)
([16]). The stratified within array normalization allows for
the biased distribution of type I and II probes by genomic
regions, with type I probes appearing more frequently in
CpG dense regions that are typically unmethylated.

Funnorm is a between-sample (functional) normalization
method that attempts to remove unwanted variation by
adjusting for covariates estimated from a control probe
matrix. Briefly, 42 summary measures are estimated
from the combined 848 control probes and type I ‘out-
of-band’ intensities, with the first 7 =2 principle compo-
nents of the summarized measures chosen as covariates
for intensity adjustment. Adjustment is performed separ-
ately in methylated and unmethylated intensities, and in
type I and II probes. For probes mapped to X and Y
chromosomes, males and females are processed separ-
ately, with ordinary quantile normalization used for
probes on the Y chromosome because of the small
number of probes (N= 416). By default the functional

Page 3 of 11

normalization is applied after Noob in the current ver-
sion of minfi package (version 1.6.0).

The summary of data preprocessing methods used in
this study is shown in Additional file 1. We note that
both SQN and Funnorm normalize features on X and
Y chromosomes in males and females separately, while
Dasen does not. Also, Funnorm only uses control
probes for between-array normalization whereas SQN
and Dasen normalize signals using the biological features
directly.

Illumina HumanMethylation450 data sets

Five datasets are used to evaluate the different process-
ing methods. One contains six technical replicates from
human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs), and is
used to investigate how the processing methods reduce
technical variances. These samples were commercially
bought, pooled human PBLs, and are the same as used
in [14]. The second data set is five lung adenocarcinomas
from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), measured using
both HM450 and whole-genome bisulfite sequencing
(WGBS) platforms. These data, shared by Titus et al. [19],
allow us to benchmark our DNA methylation estimates
for HM450 with a whole-genome sequencing-based assay.
The remaining three datasets are used to evaluate repro-
ducibility of differential methylation analysis with data
processing. The motivation is that better signal processing
should lead to better reproducibility in identifying differ-
ential methylation. Two of the latter datasets are from
TCGA with large-scale methylation differences between
cancer and normal tissue, and one is from an unpublished
brain data set, showing subtle methylation differences be-
tween cases with Alzheimer’s disease and controls.

All samples are analyzed using the Infinitum Human-
Methylation450 BeadChip, and DNA methylation levels
are reported as Beta (f) values, the proportion of methyla-
tion intensity to the total intensity, ranging from 0 to 1.
The samples from the last three studies are divided into
discovery and validation datasets for evaluating reproduci-
bility of testing differential DNA methylation. Each
processing method is performed in the discovery and
validation set separately. The separate processing will not
affect the Beta values for individual samples processed
using within-array methods (Noob, SWAN, BMIQ), but
can affect the Beta values when using between-array pro-
cessing methods (Dasen, SQN, Funnorm). The details for
defining discovery and validation data sets are described
below, and summarized in Additional file 2. All samples
are anonymized, and this study did not require institu-
tional review board approval.

The TCGA-KIRC dataset
We use the identical samples and study design imple-
mented by Fortin et al. [17]. In total, 222 kidney clear cell

--- Page 4 ---
Liu and Siegmund BMC Genomics (2016) 17:469

tumor samples and 160 non-tumor kidney samples are
assayed and included in the study. These samples are split
into discovery (training) and validation (testing) datasets.
The discovery set contains 65 tumor samples and 65 non-
tumor kidney samples, analyzed in two plates with little
variation between plates. The validation set contains 157
tumor samples and 95 non-tumor kidney samples, spread
over 4 plates and designed to have larger variations among
samples.

The TCGA-COAD dataset

A total of 321 COAD (colon adenocarcinoma) samples
(284 tumor/37 non-tumor colon) are included in this
study. These samples are selected by plate to create dis-
covery and validation datasets. No substantial plate-to-
plate variation was observed in COAD dataset (Additional
file 3). The discovery set was assigned 143 tumor samples
and 17 controls spread across 7 plates, and the validation
set 141 tumors and 20 controls run over 4 plates. All sam-
ples had fewer than 5 % missing Beta values in each color
channel and were analyzed on plates with more than 2
COAD samples.

The Brain data

A total of 376 bulk brain samples obtained from the
middle temporal gyrus were analyzed over 8 plates. Of
these, 215 are from patients diagnosed with Alzheimer’s
disease (AD) and 161 are from controls, frequency
matched by age and sex. Once more, discovery and
validation data sets are created selecting samples by
plate. A total of 180 samples across the first four
plates are assigned to the discovery set (102 diseased
and 78 controls) and 196 samples from the latter four
plates to the validation set (113 diseased and 83 con-
trols). These data were generated at the University of
Southern California.

Evaluation metrics

Improved measures of DNA methylation should in-
crease our power to detect biological associations.
However, evaluating our ability to detect true signals in
real data is complicated by the fact that we do not
know which signals are genuine. However, we can study
the reproducibility of differential methylation results
between different data sets. Higher reproducibility
would reflect more potential for a method in revealing
true signals, while poorer agreement indicates the re-
sults are more likely due to chance. We assess differen-
tial methylation by disease status for the case-control
data by applying two-sample t-tests separately in dis-
covery and validation sets. The data are analyzed on
the Beta-value scale and tests are two-sided. Several
tests of reproducibility are performed. First, result repro-
ducibility is evaluated from the lists of (ranked) p-values

Page 4 of 11

using concordance plots and ROC curves. Second, we as-
sess overlap of differentially methylated positions (DMPs)
applying the Benjamini-Yekutieli method [20] to con-
trol the false-discovery rate (FDR-adjusted p <0.05).
Benjamini-Yekutieli allows for correlation in test re-
sults and results in many fewer significant test results
than methods that ignore correlation between test
statistics.

Concordance plot

In a concordance plot, the overlap percentage is plotted
against feature list size for lists of size one to k, where
the overlap percentage is defined by the proportion of
features ranked in the top k in both the discovery and
validation set. The processing approach with higher
overlap percentages across different list sizes indicates
higher reproducibility. If the data set is underpowered
and the results are not reproducible, the overlap per-
centage follows a diagonal line through the origin, with
slope equal to the inverse of the number of features.
This approach has connections with the change of cor-
respondence plot proposed for the irreproducibility rate
framework [21].

ROC curves

ROC curves are used to quantify, for a known gold stand-
ard, the true positive and false-positive results using all
possible threshold values of a quantitative marker. Al-
though the genuine gold standard is unknown, we use the
results from the discovery subset, samples selected be-
cause they reflected lower technical variation between
plates, to define the ‘gold standard; and pick the number
of true signals from a list size with high overlap percent-
age from the concordance plots. Specifically, for the
TCGA KIRC and COAD data sets, the features from the
top 100,000 ranked p values in the discovery subset are
defined as “true signal”. For the brain data, we anticipate
small differences and only select the top 100 in the discov-
ery set as “true signals”. These same list sizes are used in
{17] for evaluation of strong and weak signals. The area
under the curve (AUC) is computed to assess the per-
formance of a method. A method with good reproducibil-
ity will have an ROC curve above the diagonal line, with
high AUC. The ROC analysis is performed using ROCR
package in R (version 1.0-7).

Feature filtering

A total of 485,512 cytosines are queried by the HM450
BeadChip array. For method evaluation, we filter probes
with missing Beta values across samples. For the TCGA
and brain data sets we also exclude probes mapped to
the X or Y chromosomes, containing a common SNP
(minor allele frequency > 0.1) within 10 bp of the target
cytosine, or map to multiple regions of the genome. This

--- Page 5 ---
Liu and Siegmund BMC Genomics (2016) 17:469

filtering results in 485,110 features in the PBL dataset,
371370 in KIRC, 384470 in COAD, and 360894 in the
brain data set.

It is worth noting that the minfi and methylumi pack-
ages in R have different criteria in assigning missing to
Beta values. In minfi, missing values (“NAs”) are
assigned when both the raw methylated and unmethy-
lated intensities are zero. Although this catches all fea-
tures with failed probes that do not fluoresce, it allows
features fluorescing at background levels for both M
and U probes to have Beta values near 0.5. We favor
the additional assignment of ‘NA’ to features that do
not have at least one of the M and U intensities fluor-
esce above background. Such masking is applied in the
methylumi package, where the detection p values are
used for determining missing Beta values; the detection
p-value reports the quantile from the distribution of
600 negative control probes (from the same color chan-
nel) for the larger of the methylated or unmethylated
intensity. Then, the Beta value will be assigned missing
if the corresponding detection p-value is more than
0.05 (not above background). This can result in a much
larger number of missing Beta values than assigned in
the minfi package. We use missing values assigned by
the methylumi package.

Results

Reduction in technical variance

We assess the ability of preprocessing methods to re-
duce technical variance and adjust type I/II bias using
six technical replicates from commercially available
pooled human male peripheral blood lymphoctytes
(PBLs) assayed as part of a larger experiment [22] and
previously evaluated in [14]. Figure la shows variability
in the density distributions of the Beta values for the six
replicates that is no longer evident after processing the
data using Noob + BMIQ (Fig. 1b). The density distribu-
tions, stratified by probe type, appear in Additional file
4. For the raw data the density distributions vary consid-
erably across the six replicates, especially among type II
probes; the reduced dynamic range of raw Beta values
for type II probes relative to type I probes was also ap-
parent [5]. All of the normalization methods increase
the dynamic range of the type II probes with perhaps
the greatest reduction in type I/type II bias seen when
combining Noob with BMIQ. It is worth of noting that
SQN changes the distribution of type I probes most no-
ticeably, presumably because it uses type II probes as the
anchors when normalizing between two probe designs in
each sub-category (defined by genomic context relative
to CpG islands).

Figure 1c shows a smoothed curve summarizing a
scatterplot of standard deviation versus mean Beta
values across six replicates for all probes. All processing
methods reduce the average standard deviation com-
pared to the raw data. The correlation between standard
deviations and means is least obvious after application of
Dasen and SQN, possibly due to the fact that both
Dasen and SQN are between-array methods that
normalize methylated and unmethylated intensities sep-
arately. Interestingly, the within-array methods are com-
petitive with the between-array methods despite the
application to technical replicates for which all between-
array assumptions are met. Also, Funnorm shows good
stability despite the use of principal components adjust-
ment estimated from only six arrays.

Figure 1d shows a boxplot of the average of the abso-
lute difference in Beta value for the 32,713 pairs of adja-
cent type I/II probes that lie within 200 bp of each
other. Based on the well identified spatial correlation of
DNA methylation at scales < 500 bp [23], we expect that
the ideal normalization algorithms should minimize the
averaged absolute difference, as previously observed by
Teschendorff et al [6]. Noob + BMIQ seems to show the
greatest reduction in deviation between measures from
adjacent type I/type II probes, while SQN does not per-
form well with respect to reducing type I/type II bias.

Cross-platform comparison with whole-genome bisulfite
sequencing

We used five lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) samples from
TCGA to benchmark the post-processing HM450 Beta
value estimates to estimates from WGBS. The number of
features available for cross-platform comparison ranged
from 110,962 to 199,441 after restricting to cytosines with
a minimum sequencing depth of 10. Loess curves sum-
marizing the relationship between the Beta values from
the two platforms showed Noob + BMIQ estimates were

Page 6 of 11

most similar to WGBS (Fig. 2a). The Pearson correlation
was highest for Noob + BMIQ (0.953), lowest for SQN
(0.930) and Dasen (0.937), and intermediate for the raw
data (0.942). The other four LUAD samples also showed
the highest Pearson correlations for Noob + BMIQ proc-
essed data (Fig. 2b).

Reproducibility of differential DNA methylation analysis
The ability to reliably identify features differentially
methylated by disease subtype will depend on the
strength of the biological signal and noise due to tech-
nical issues. A multidimensional scaling plot of the top
5000 variable features allows us to visualize sample
distances by disease state for our three studies (Fig. 3).
For the KIRC and COAD data sets, the first dimension
explains 49.8 and 43.7 % respectively, of the total vari-
ance in Beta values from the raw signals, with the sec-
ond dimension explaining only 5.9 and 6.0 % (Fig. 3a,
b). These two scaling dimensions allow us to visualize a
clear separation between cancer and control samples
for both the discovery and validation data sets indicat-
ing a large biological signal even in the raw data. On
the other hand, the first and second scaling dimensions
for the brain data only explain 29.9 and 3.8 % of the
total variance, and it is not until the 18* dimension
that the cumulative proportion of variance exceeds
50 %. Case-control differences are not apparent until
the 10‘" dimension (t-test p = 0.002) (Fig. 3c). Figure 3d
shows scaling dimensions 1 and 2 for the brain data
with samples colored by processing plate. We see that
the 1% scaling dimension is associated with sample
plate, with plate 5 and plate 8 samples appearing more
towards the right side of the figure.

We use concordance plots to present the overlap in
the top ranking DMPs as a function of list size when ap-
plying the different processing methods. Combining the
methods Noob with BMIQ or SWAN always showed

igher reproducibility than any of the three methods
alone so the results for the individual methods are not
shown. For the two cancer data sets, all within-array
combination methods show similar performance to one
another and all show higher concordance compared to
the raw data (Fig. 4a and c). The performances of
between-array methods show more variability. Funnorm,
a method that utilizes control probes for normalization,
always performs better than the raw data, but not better
than the within-array methods. SQN and Dasen, two
between-array methods that only use signal from the
biological features for normalization, only perform better
than the raw data for the KIRC study; for COAD, they
are worse (Grey lines in Fig. 4a, c). The poor perform-
ance might be due to the substantial heterogeneity
among the COAD tumor samples relative to control

samples (as is shown in Fig. 3b), and normalizing inten-
sities across samples may hide true biological signals. In
contrast to the concordance plot which reflects sensitivity
across different list sizes, the ROC curve shows sensitivity
across different false positive rates for a specific list size.
In our study the results of ROC curve are consistent with
the overlap plot analysis, showing high sensitivity for
Noob + BMIQ, Noob+SWAN, and Funnorm +BMIQ
(Fig. 4b, d with a, c, respectively). And whereas there is
little variation in sensitivity among the evaluated
methods for the KIRC study, the COAD study shows a
clear loss in sensitivity when performing between-
sample normalization using SQN (Fig. 4d).

We note that for each of these two cancer datasets,
the concordance after processing nears 85 %. However,
the concordance of discoveries is above 70 % even for

the raw data at a list size of 15,000 features. The overlap
ercentage for the raw COAD data is over 80 % for the
top 50,000 features. These results are not surprising
given that the separate clustering of cancer and non-
cancer samples in the MDS plots reflects substantial
variation in DNA methylation between groups with
genuine signals very likely to be detected and repro-
duced. The higher homogeneity of colon control samples
and their homogeneity relative to cancer samples might
explain the higher reproducibility of DMPs in the COAD
study (see Fig. 3b).

Reproducibility for the Brain data is much lower than
for the cancer data, which was not surprising either based
on the earlier MDS figures. This time, the fraction of over-
lapping discoveries from the analysis of the raw data
appears essentially random (Fig. 5a); however, the proc-
essed data sets are able to show a small enrichment in the
overlap of top hits. This time the greatest overlap occured
for the between-array method Funnorm combined with
(within-array) BMIQ. The advantage over Noob + BMIQ,
the second best method, was modest. We note that the
strictly within-array methods Noob + BMIQ or Noob +
SWAN appeared as good as or better than the between-
array (Noob+)Funnorm alone, showing the importance of

correcting for probe design bias. This time the between-
array methods SQN and Dasen were always much better
than the raw data, but never achieved the reproducibility
of the top within-array method, Noob + BMIQ. The same
results are seen from an ROC curve analysis using the top
100 features as the gold-standard (Fig. 5b). All together,
these results suggest that correction for technical effects
in these data is needed to find the more subtle biological
signal. Furthermore, the modest overlap percentage after
normalization led us to investigate RUVm, the new variant
of remove unwanted variation designed for removing
batch effects in DNA methylation data [24]. We evaluated
RUVm for batch effect correction, comparing it to com-
peting methods surrogate variable analysis (SVA) [25] and
ComBat [26].

RUVm improved result reproducibility, outperforming
both SVA and ComBat. In fact ComBat showed a minor
loss in reproducibility over no batch correction, suggesting
there was confounding between samples and BeadChips.
Applying RUVm to Noob + BMIQ processed brain data
resulted in a nearly 30 % improvement in overlap percent-
age, achieving a max 63 % overlap in the brain data set, up
from 36 % observed using normalization methods alone
(Fig. 5c). The results using RUVm depended heavily on

showing a 65 % increase in sensitivity compared to

Lastly, we investigated whether our results are sensi-
tive to the single split of the data into discovery and val-
idation sets. We resampled the brain data ten times into
new discovery and validation sets, each time computing
the AUC for the raw data, the data processed with Noob
+ BMIQ, and the data processed with Noob + BMIQ +
RUVm. There was very little overlap in distributions,
with AUC interquartile ranges (IQR) 0.65-0.68 for the
raw data, 0.7-0.82 for Noob + BMIQ and 0.95-0.97 for
Noob + BMIQ + RUVm. This order of results held their
rank, and suggested that one data split was representa-
tive, and the performance does not change with repeated
sampling.

Discussion

In this study nine preprocessing methods for Illumina
HM450 array data are applied and compared, using
combinations of three within-array and three between-
array methods. Since different normalization methods
address different technical effects in the data, we take
advantage of this diversity of approaches and combine
methods addressing different mechanisms.

Analysis of technical replicates showed that different
methods optimized different assessment criterion. The
within-array methods Noob + BMIQ and Noob + SWAN
were favored at removing type I/type II bias, while the
between-array methods Funnorm, SQN and Dasen,

reduced between-sample variability the best. However,
a recent paper by Lemire et al. found Noob +BMIQ
performed best in reducing differences between Beta
values in intra-plate duplicates [27]. SQN, a between-
array method that normalizes intensities between typel/
II probes, did the least to remove probe type bias; this
might be due to the fact that SQN utilizes type II
probes, those known to show greater bias, as “anchors”
when normalizing type I intensities. The results consist-
ently showed that a priori background correction and
dye-bias normalization using Noob improved both bias
and variance over type I/type II correction methods
alone (BMIQ and SWAN). Analysis of paired HM450
and WGBS data showed the highest Pearson correla-
tions after using Noob + BMIQ to process the HM450
data.

When evaluation focused on detecting reproducible
DMPs across different disease data sets, within-array
normalization and between-array methods that relied
only on control features consistently displayed the
highest reproducibility. The performance of between-
array methods that utilized biological features for
normalization depended on the characteristics of the
data set. When disease state was not associated with
the principal scaling dimension, between-array methods
tended to improve sensitivity of reproduced signals.
Still, they never outperformed the best within-array
methods. Furthermore, when the biological signal was
strong, they had the potential to behave worse than no
processing at all. This was the case for the COAD data

set for which the first two principal scaling dimensions
were both associated with disease status. It also agreed
with the separate finding of a lower validation rate after
SQN by Wu et al. [9]. Overall, we found the within-
array method Noob + BMIQ to consistently provide the
most reproducible signal detection across the three data
sets.

We evaluated three batch-correction methods capable
of removing additional variation not accounted for by
data processing (RUVm, SVA, and ComBat), to see
whether they could improve the low reproducibility of
DMPs in the brain data. Both RUVm and SVA im-
proved reproducibility, however using ComBat to adjust
for BeadChip effects reduced it. This suggested that
there was confounding of case-control comparisons by
BeadChip. Application of RUVm increased DMP repro-
ducibility in the brain data the most, and interestingly,
a large variation in performance appeared depending
on the preprocessing method applied; Noob + BMIQ
turned in substantially superior reproducibility com-
pared to competing approaches.

Finally, Beta regression has been proposed as a more
powerful test of differential DNA methylation than t-
tests [28]. However, since current software for Beta re-
gression is slow, and our focus was on finding the most
reproducible processing method instead of the most
sensitive test, we used t-tests on the Beta values. Data
that are subjected to variance-stabilizing transforma-
tions prior to t-tests might show higher sensitivity for
differential testing [28], with the difference (in sensitiv-
ity) a function of both the effect size and sample size.
The already high overlap percentages observed in our
cancer studies suggest that data transformation is unlikely
to change the results. For the brain data, it is possible that
data transformation could improve the overlap percent-
ages for the different normalization methods. The analyses
with batch correction were performed on the logit scale,
so these potentially represent the most sensitive t-test
result.

Conclusions

This study provides a comprehensive comparison of the
currently popular normalization methods in processing
HM450 array data. Combinations of methods are applied
and compared in five data sets, ranging from cancer data
to Alzheimer’s brain data, and showing distinctly differ-
ent variation in DNA methylation. We find that the
combination of Noob + BMIQ, a within-array method,
performs well in reducing technical variance, adjusting
typel/II bias, and gaining reproducibility in differential
methylation analysis. At the same time, the between-
array normalization methods might hurt the data when
there are global methylation alterations. For differential
DNA methylation analysis RUVm was the most powerful

batch correction method, and it performed best on data
first processed with Noob + BMIQ. The combination of
methods and comprehensive comparisons in our study
provide valuable insights in processing HM450 Bead-
Chip data.

Abstract

Background Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a multifaceted condition that affects
most body systems. There is currently no known diagnostic biomarker; instead, diagnosis is dependent on application
of symptom-based case criteria following exclusion of any other potential medical conditions. While there are some
studies that report potential biomarkers for ME/CFS, their efficacy has not been validated. The aim of this systematic
review is to collate and appraise literature pertaining to a potential biomarker(s) which may effectively differentiate
E/CFS patients from healthy controls.

Methods This systematic review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews
and Meta-Analyses and Cochrane review guidelines. PubMed, Embase and Scopus were systematically searched

or articles containing “biomarker” and "ME/CFS" keywords in the abstract or title and if they included the following
criteria: (1) were observational studies published between December 1994 and April 2022; (2) involved adult human
participants; (3) full text is available in English (4) original research; (5) diagnosis of ME/CFS patients made according to
the Fukuda criteria (1994), Canadian Consensus Criteria (2003), International Consensus Criteria (2011) or Institute of
edicine Criteria (2015); (6) study investigated potential biomarkers of ME/CFS compared to healthy controls. Quality
and Bias were assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklist for Case Control Studies.

Results A total of 101 publications were included in this systematic review. Potential biomarkers ranged from
genetic/epigenetic (19.8%), immunological (29.7%), metabolomics/mitochondrial/microbiome (14.85%), endovascu-
ar/circulatory (17.82%), neurological (7.92%), ion channel (8.91%) and physical dysfunction biomarkers (8.91%). Most
of the potential biomarkers reported were blood-based (79.2%). Use of lymphocytes as a model to investigate ME/CFS
pathology was prominent among immune-based biomarkers. Most biomarkers had secondary (43.56%) or tertiary
(54.47%) selectivity, which is the ability for the biomarker to identify a disease-causing agent, and a moderate (59.40%)
to complex (39.60%) ease-of-detection, including the requirement of specialised equipment.

Conclusions All potential ME/CFS biomarkers differed in efficiency, quality, and translatability as a diagnostic marker.
Reproducibility of findings between the included publications were limited, however, several studies validated the
involvement of immune dysfunction in the pathology of ME/CFS and the use of lymphocytes as a model to inves-
tigate the pathomechanism of illness. The heterogeneity shown across many of the included studies highlights the
need for multidisciplinary research and uniform protocols in ME/CFS biomarker research.

Background

Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome
(ME/CFS) is a debilitating condition that may affect
between 17 and 24 million people worldwide [1]. The
clinical presentation of this illness is complex. Patients
experience a heterogeneous array of symptoms that fluc-
tuate over time and affect multiple body systems includ-
ing, but not limited to, immunological, neurological,
endocrinological, and cardiovascular manifestations [2].
Severity of symptoms range between patients from mild
to severe where some patients are wheelchair or bed-
bound [2].

There is currently no definitive diagnostic test; how-
ever, there is a significant body of biological evidence for
this condition. Currently, ME/CFS is diagnosed using
self-report case criteria following exclusion of any other
potential medical explanation [3]. A systematic review by
Brurberg et al. identified 20 different definitions used for
ME/CFS [3]. The most frequent definitions commonly
used in research and clinical practice include the follow-
ing: the Fukuda criteria (FC), the Canadian Consensus
Criteria (CCC), and the International Consensus Crite-
ria (ICC) [2, 4, 5]. The Institute of Medicine (IOMC) also
released a definition of ME/CFS in 2015 that is some-
times used in research [6]. One of the major differentiat-
ing features between the later definitions is the cardinal
symptom “post-exertional neuroimmune exhaustion”
(PENE). PENE occurs upon exertion that results in
severe neuroimmune responses [2, 5]. Lack of definitive
biomarkers complicates diagnosis and management of
ME/CFS resulting in a significant number of people that
remain undiagnosed. Furthermore, the reliance on exclu-
sion of other causes of symptoms also results in delays in
diagnosis as well as increased costs due to resource con-
sumption [7].

A biomarker is defined as biological entity that can
effectively and objectively differentiate one condition
from healthy controls (HC) or from another condition
[8]. A biomarker can range from, radiological, physical-
or laboratory-based [9]. An optimal biomarker should
have a clinical endpoint that is measurable over a short
period of time with minimal variability and have a suffi-
ciently higher signal-to-noise ratio [9]. Byrnes and Weigl
described key features for optimal selection of biomark-
ers including trade-offs between complexity of detection,
sensitivity/specificity and selectivity its ability to identify
disease-causing agents [10].

Despite no definitive consensus on a molecular bio-
marker multiple research studies have investigated the

prognostic potential of some markers for ME/CFS. This
systematic review aims to collate evidence on suggested
biomarkers for ME/CFS, critically examine their method-
ology, and evaluate their efficacy as well as their suitabil-
ity as a biomarker for ME/CFS.

Methods

Literature search
This systematic review was conducted according to the
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and
Meta-analyses (PRISMA) and Cochrane review guide-
lines [11, 12]. Prior to commencement, our protocol was
compared with published listings on the PROSPERO
(National Institute for Health Research) for duplica-
tion and prospectively registered on the database (ID:
CRD42022293059). The following databases PubMed,
Embase and Scopus were systematically searched for
literature with biomarker key words in conjunction
with fatigue syndrome, chronic (a full comprehen-
sive search code can be found in Additional File 1). The
Boolean operator “AND” was used to combine the terms.
{abstract/title] filters were applied to confine search
to key terms existing only in the abstract and title. The
search was expanded to include all Medical Subject
Headings (MeSH) terms. Reference list checking and a
citation search was conducted but no additional pub

cations were retrieved. All included articles underwent
peer review. Unpublished literature or pre-print data-
bases such as medRxiv or BioRxiv were not searched. The
literature search was conducted on 30th May 2022.

Inclusion criteria

Studies were selected if they complied with the fol-
lowing inclusion criteria: (1) observational study pub-
lished after 1994; (2) study involved human participants
aged 18 years or older; (3) full text available in English;
(4) original research; (5) diagnosis of ME/CFS patients
were made according to the FC (1994), CCC (2003), ICC
(2011), or IOMC (2015); (6) study investigated potential
biomarker/s of ME/CFS compared to HC.

Exclusion criteria

Studies were excluded if they met any of the following
exclusion criteria: (1) was an interventional study; (2)
written prior to the establishment of the FC in Decem-
ber 15th 1994; (3) not available as full text or written
in English; (4) was not an original study type including
reviews, duplicate studies, or case reports; (5) use of
other diagnostic criteria instead of FC, CCC, ICC, IOMC;

--- Page 3 ---
Maksoud et al. BMC Medicine (2023) 21:189

(6) studies that are not within the scope of this review or
did not compare to HC.

Selection of studies

Duplicates were removed using Endnote version 20
(Endnote, Clarivate™, Philadelphia, USA) through the
automated duplicate removal tool. The references were
scanned for any remaining duplicates which were manu-
ally removed. The reference management tool Rayyan
was used to sort and store the remaining publications
[13]. Abstracts were first screened for suitability, followed
by a full-text screening. These processes were conducted
independently by RM and CM and any discrepancies
between the two authors were compared and resolved
through discussion. The final articles that were included
were reviewed and validated by all listed authors.

Data extraction

Following the selection of papers, relevant data were
manually extracted including (1) study type; (2) criteria;
(3) sample size (4) age; (5) sex; (6) body mass index (BMI);
(7) illness duration; (8) biomarker; (9) classification (10)
selectivity; (11) ease of detection; and (12) receiver oper-
ator characteristic (ROC) area under the curve (AUC)/
sensitivity/specificity/accuracy; (13) findings. Studies
were sorted according to type of biomarker from the
following: genetic, immunological, metabolomics/mito-
chondrial/microbiome, endovascular/circulatory, neuro-
logical, ion channel and physical biomarkers. Due to lack
of homogeneity between studies, a meta-analysis could
not be conducted. Selectivity and ease of detection were
included based on Byrnes and Weigl’s analytical bio-
marker for diagnostic application framework [10]. Selec-
tivity refers to the ability of the biomarker to identify a
disease-causing agent ranging from primary (direct) to
tertiary (indirect) and ease of detection refers to the com-
plexity of biomarker identification ranging from easy to
complex.

Quality analysis

All publications were assessed for quality and bias using
the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Check-
list for Case Control Studies (JBI CACCCS). JBI CAC-
CCS was selected for quality analysis as the checklist
is validated and internationally recognised [14]. This
checklist has also been updated to reflect advancements
in bias risk assessment and adheres with requirements
for the current PRISMA guidelines [14]. Quality analy-
sis was conducted independently by two authors (RM
and CM). Each checklist item assesses the following: (1)
group matching; (2) source population; (3) criteria; (4)
method of exposure; (5) assessment of exposure; (6) iden-
tification of confounding variables; (7) management of

Page 3 of 18

confounding variables; (8) measurement of outcomes; (9)
exposure period selection; (10) statistical analysis. Items
4, 5, and 9 were excluded in selected papers as they did
not have an exposure. JBI CACCCS is a qualitative check-
list, and there is no incorporation of a scoring system;
hence, no studies were omitted based on quality [14].

Results

PubMed (303), Embase (340) and Scopus (259) retrieved
a total of 902 articles. Following removal of duplicates
and application of inclusion and exclusion criteria, the
total number of articles were refined to 101. The system-
atic process as conducted by PRISMA guidelines is out-
lined in Fig. 1.

Overview of articles

The study and participant characteristics as well as find-
ings of each article is summarised in Additional File 2. In
total, 98 out of 101 included publications were observa-
tional case-control studies [15—112].Two of these stud-
ies also included non-ME/CFS affected blood relatives in
addition to HC [102, 109]. One publication was an obser-
vational twin study [113], and the remaining two publica-
tions were prospective longitudinal linked panel studies
(114, 115].

Participant and study characteristics

The average sample size of ME/CFS patients and
HC included across all the studies was 1=43.83 and
n=38.34, respectively. The average age of ME/CFS
patients was 45.40+8.76 years old and the average age
of HC was 43.43+9.15. Females were more prominent
whereby on average 76% of ME/CFS patients and 72%
of HC were female. Mean illness duration for ME/CFS
patients ranged between 4.5 and 22 years with the aver-
age duration being 10.30 years.

In total, 56 of the studies recruited patients that met
the FC [15, 19, 21, 22, 24, 28, 31, 35-42, 44, 45, 49, 50,
52, 53, 59, 61-69, 71, 78, 79, 83, 84, 86-89, 92-95, 98, 99,
101, 102, 105, 108, 111-115]. Fourteen studies recruited
patients that met the CCC [17, 23, 32, 46, 47, 57, 58, 73,
82, 91, 100, 103, 104, 107]. One study recruited patients
diagnosed with the ICC [25], and another study recruited
patients diagnosed with IOMC [34]. A combination of FC
and CCC was used to diagnose patients in 19 studies [16,
18, 26, 27, 30, 48, 51, 54, 56, 60, 70, 72, 74-77, 85, 90, 97],
a combination of FC and ICC was used to select patients
in three studies [55, 106, 109], and a combination of CCC
and ICC was used to select patients in one study [29]. A
combination of the FC and IOMC was used in one study
[41]. Kitami et al. recruited patients that met either the
FC, ICC or IOMC [55]. The remaining studies recruited a

combination of patients diagnosed with the FC, CCC and
ICC definitions [80, 81].

In total, 76 of the biomarkers were blood-based
(75.25%). Most of the biomarkers had either secondary
(43.56%) or tertiary (53.47%) selectivity [15-47, 49-90,
92-96, 98-115] and had moderate (59.40%) to complex
(39.60%) ease-of-detection including the involvement of
specialised equipment [15-37, 39-115]. AUC, sensitivity,
specificity, and accuracy were reported in only some of
the studies (1=35, 34.65%). Due to the limited number
of studies that included these values, an average was not
calculated.

The studies have been grouped according to type
of biomarker in Additional File 2 including genetic
(Table S1), immunological (Table $2), metabolomics/
mitochondrial/microbiome (Table $3), endovascular/cir-
culatory (Table $4), neurological (Table S5), ion channel
(Table S6) and physical biomarkers (Table S7).

Literature reporting on genetic/epigenetic biomarkers
There were 20 studies that discussed genetic/epigenetic
biomarkers in ME/CFS patients compared with HC

(additional File 2, table S1) [16, 18, 20, 21, 25, 27, 43, 52,
59, 60, 67, 68, 71, 82, 87, 88, 92, 103, 108, 111]. Two of
the included publications investigated deoxyribonucleic
acid (DNA) changes through single-nucleotide poly-
morphisms (SNPs) [67, 68]. Eleven SNPs in natural killer
(NK) cells from ME/CFS patients were identified by Mar-
shall-Gradisnik et al., and SNPs in five of these SNPs were
associated with transient receptor potential melastatin
3 (TRPM3). There were 14 SNPs that were associated
with nicotinic and muscarinic genes. From these SNPs,
16 genotypes were identified [67]. In ME/CFS B cells, 78
SNPs were found where 35 of these changes occurred in
muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M3 (mAChM3) [68].
Other SNPs that were identified included nicotinic ace-
tylcholine receptor delta, nicotinic acetylcholine receptor
alpha 9, TRPV2, TRPM3, TRPM4, mAChRM3 and cho-
linergic receptor muscarinic 5 [68].

Six studies reported altered miRNA in ME/CFS
patients compared with HC [18, 20-22, 82, 87]. Three
studies investigated levels of miRNA-21 (miR-21) [16, 18,
21]. The levels of miR-21 were variable across the stud-
ies [16, 18, 21]. Blauensteiner et al. reported higher levels

--- Page 5 ---
Maksoud et al. BMC Medicine (2023) 21:189

of miR-21, miR-34a, miR-92a, miR-126 and miR-200c
in plasma of ME/CFS patients compared with HC [18].
Brenu et al. reported a significantly lowermiR-21 in
CD8* T cells and NK cells in ME/CFS patients compared
with HC [21]. In extracellular vesicles (EV), differences in
miR-21 between ME/CFS and HC did not reach signifi-
cance [16]. Almenar-Pérez et al. found that there were 17
miRNAs that were differentially expressed in peripheral
blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) [16].

Brenu et al. reported that hsa-miR-127-3p, hsa-miR-
142-5p, and hsa-miR-143-3p were significantly upreg-
ulated in ME/CFS patients using a combination of
high- throughput sequencing and real-time quantitative
polymerase chain reaction analysis [20]. Nepotchatykh
et al. assessed circulating miRNA signatures following
induction of post-exertional malaise (PEM) [82]. This
study comprised of a discovery phase to identify poten-
tial differentially expressed miRNA [82]. Seventeen miR-
NAs were identified and following individual detection of
miRNA, machine learning methods verified 11 of these
miRNA as significant [82]. At baseline, hsa-miR-28-5p,
hsa-miR-127-3p, hsa-miR-140-5p, hsa-miR-374b-5p,
hsa-miR4433a-5p, and hsa-miR-6819-3p were signifi-
cantly higher in ME/CFS patients compared with HC.
Expression levels of hsa-miR-150-5p, hsa-miR-486-5p,
and hsa-miR-3620-3p were significantly elevated follow-
ing PEM induced after 90 min of stimulation [82]. Petty
et al. identified 34 significantly upregulated miRNA
markers in ME/CFS patients compared with HC. The
most profound differences occurred in NK cells [87].

Eight studies investigated changes in mRNA. All stud-
ies described significantly differentially expressed mRNA
[25, 43, 59, 60, 71, 88, 92, 111]. One study detected up to
366 differentially expressed genes in ME/CFS patients
compared with HC [43]. Chacko et al. reported that there
were 92 differentially expressed protein kinase genes: 37
genes that were significantly upregulated and 55 genes
that were significantly downregulated in severe ME/
CFS patients compared to HC [25]. White et al. found
that mRNA in P2X4, TRPV1 (vanilloid), CD14 and adr-
energic receptors was elevated in ME/CFS patients com-
pared with HC post-exercise [111]. ME/CFS patients
with comorbid fibromyalgia also showed higher levels of
mRNA in acid-sensing ion channel 3 (ASIC3) and P2X5.
Elevated mRNA in P2X4, P2X5 and ASIC3 was also
described by Light et al. in ME/CFS patients following
exercise [59]. This increase was transient and occurred
between 0.5 and 48 h post-exercise. In the same study,
alpha-2A, beta-1, beta-2, catechol-O-methyltransferase,
interleukin (IL)-10 and toll-like receptor 4 were also
higher in ME/CFS patients [60]. An increase in mRNA in
most sensory and adrenergic receptors post-exercise for
48 h was described in 71% of patients with ME/CFS in

Page 5 of 18

a later study by Light et al. [59]. The increase in mRNA
post-exercise was associated with pain and fatigue. In
the remaining 29% of ME/CFS patients, adrenergic a-2A
mRNA was lower compared with HC and this was more
common in patients with orthostatic intolerance [59].
Iacob et al. reported that greater gene expression of
purinergic and cellular modulators and nociception and
stress mediators were positively associated with a diag-
nosis of ME/CFS [52].

Two studies investigated epigenetic modification in
ME/CFS patients compared with HC [27, 71]. De Vega
et al. reported 12,608 differentially methylated sites in
ME/CFS patients compared with HC [27]. Metselaar
et al. found that there were 48 CpGs that were predictive
of ME/CFS [71]. Metselaar et al. utilised data from De
Vega et al. in combination with other published datasets
in their analysis [27, 71].

Literature reporting on immunological biomarkers

Thirty studies investigated immune cell function changes
in ME/CFS patients compared with HC (Additional File
2, Table $2) (22, 26, 33, 36, 37, 45, 46, 48-51, 54, 56, 61,
62, 64, 65, 72, 84, 91, 97, 99, 102, 104, 107, 109, 110, 114,
115]. Five of the studies reported reduced NKCC in ME/
CFS patients compared with HC [37, 65, 67, 102, 114].
Other NK cell-specific features include lower expres-
sion levels of DPPIV/C26 in ME/CFS [37]. Brenu et al.
described higher levels of the lytic protein perforin, but
lower levels of Granzyme A and Granzyme K in NK cells
of ME/CFS patients compared with HC [22]. One study,
Cliff et al., reported no significant differences in NK cell
numbers, subtype proportions and cell cytotoxicity in
frozen biobanked samples [26]. Theorell et al. found that
there were no significant changes in cytotoxic lympho-
cytes including NK cell and T cell population phenotype
and function in ME/CFS compared with HC [107]. Brenu
et al. assessed NKCC longitudinally over a 12-month
eriod. Differences in NKCC were significantly differ-
ent across the three timepoints, and NKCC was con-
sistently lower in ME/CFS patients compared with HC
across the different timepoints [114]. Other NK cell sub-
sets such as NKCD69 and NKCD56 were reported to be
igher in ME/CFS patients [91]. Hardcastle et al. found
that there were significantly reduced CD56“"CD16~ NK
cell CD2+and CD18*CD2*. Severe ME/CFS patients
ad significantly increased CD18*CD11c "in the
CD56“"CD16~NK cell phenotype and_ significantly
reduced NKp46 in CD56"8'CD16% "NK cells [50].
Hanevik et al. reported that post-giardiasis ME/CFS
atients had significantly lower NK cell levels compared
to HC [49]. The complement pathway post-exercise was
investigated in two studies [84, 99]. Sorensen et al. found
that complement split product C4a was significantly

Maksoud et al. BMC Medicine (2023) 21:189

higher in ME/CFS patients compared with HC six hours
post-exercise [99]. Conversely, Nijs et al. reported no
difference in complement split product levels as well as
elastase activity or IL-1 [84].

Higher non-classical monocytes were found in ME/
CFS patients compared with HC [109]. There was no
significant difference, however, between patients and
non-affected family members [109]. Sung et al. also
examined differences between ME/CFS patients, related
family members and HC [102]. Both ME/CFS patients
and related family members showed lower antibody-
dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) com-
pared with HC [102]. Autoantibodies were measured
in four studies [48, 62, 104, 110]. Vernon et al. reported
no significant autoantibodies across the whole ME/CFS
group compared with HC [110]. Szklarski et al. found
that there was an association with lower levels of sCD26
and increased levels of autoantibodies against adrenergic
receptors (AR) and mAChR3 [104]. Maes et al. identified
that plasma peroxide and oxidised low-density lipopro-
tein antibody concentrations were significantly higher in
ME/CFS patients compared to HC [62]. There was low
association with these antibodies and the fibromyalgia
and chronic fatigue syndrome rating scale [62]. In a study
conducted by Halpin et al., ME/CFS patients had higher
levels of anti-EBV-dUTPase antibodies and anti-human
dUTPase antibodies compared to HC [48]. ME/CFS
patients with coexisting irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)
showed an association with immunoglobulin lambda
constant region 7 and ME/CFS patients without IBS
showed association with immunoglobulin kappa variable
region 3—11[72]. In ME/CFS with post-infectious onset,
sCD26 levels were positively associated with activated T
cells, liver enzymes, creatine kinase and lactate dehydro-
genase. Rivas et al. reported significantly lower values of
T regulatory cells in ME/CFS patients compared with HC
[91]. Two hundred and fifty six peptide signatures were
detected that could significantly differentiate between
ME/CFS patients and HC based on AUC values [46].
Humoral immunity profiling identified 25 peptides that
effectively differentiate between ME/CFS patients and
HC [97]. An increase in activation of antigens on CD8* T
lymphocytes including CD3t, CD8*t, CD8* CD38", and
CD8t HLA-DR + were described by Maes et al. [61]. Espi-
nosa et al. found that there was a significant decrease in
CD57 molecule expressed per T cell as well as percentage
of cells expressing CD57 in ME/CFS patients compared
to HC [33]. Hardcastle et al. reported that moderate ME/
CFS patients had significantly increased CD8*CD45RA
effector memory T cells, signalling lymphocytic activa-
tion molecule expression on NK cells, killer cell immu-
noglobulin-like receptor 2DL5A on CD4*T cells, and
BTLA4*on CD4*T central memory cells [50]. In a

longitudinal study also conducted by Hardcastle et al.,
iNKT CD62L increased in expression over time in mod-
erate ME/CFS patients. At six months, naive CD8*T
cells, CD8™ CD4- and CD56~CD16" iNKT phenotypes,
y52T cells and effector memory subsets were signifi-
cantly increased in severe ME/CFS patients. Severe ME/
CFS also had significantly reduced CD56""8"'cp164™
NKG2D, CD56“"CD16~ KIR2DL2/DL3, CD94~CD11a—
y81T cells, and CD62L*CD11a™ yd1T cells at six months
{115}.

Nine studies investigated cytokines as a potential bio-
marker for ME/CFS [22, 28, 36, 45, 51, 53, 56, 64, 114].
The repertoire of cytokines being measured mostly varied
between studies. The following cytokines were reported
to be significantly higher in ME/CFS patients compared
with HC: IL-1, TNF-a, IL-10, IL-13, IL-16, INF-g, and IL-
17A [22, 53, 54, 56, 64]. In a study conducted by Fletcher
et al., the following cytokines were elevated in ME/CFS
patients compared to HC: LTa, IL-la, IL-1,IL-4, IL-5,
IL-6, and IL-12 [36]. The following cytokines showed
good biomarker potentials based on area under the curve:
IL-5, LTa, IL-4, and IL-12 [36]. In contrast, Groven et al.
reported that levels of IL-10, 1L-17, and TNF-a were
significantly lower in ME/CFS patients [45]. Landi et al.
reported significantly lower levels of IL-16 and IL-7 [56].
IL-17F and CXCL8 were found to be significantly lower
in ME/CFS patients in a study conducted by Khaiboul-
lina et al. [54]. Hornig et al. reported an increase in acti-
vation of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in early
stages of ME/CFS [51]. Higher levels of inflammatory
cytokines were also reported by Domingo et al. A longi-
tudinal study conducted by Brenu et al. found that there
was significant variability of cytokine levels at different
timepoints: baseline (T1), 6 months (T2) and 12 months
(T3). After mitogenic stimulation, there were signifi-
cant increases in IL-10, IFN-y and TNF-a at T1. IL-10,
and IL-17A were significantly decreased at T2. IL-2 was
increased at T3 in ME/CFS patients [114].

Literature reporting on metabolomics/mitochondrial/
microbiome biomarkers

Five studies reported on changes in metabolites in ME/
CFS patients compared with HC (Additional File 2,
Table S3) [17, 41, 42, 76, 96]. All of the studies inves-
tigated metabolites in blood [17, 41, 42, 76, 96]. There
were no common significant metabolites between the
studies. Armstrong et al. described lower glutamine
levels in ME/CFS patients [17] and Germain et al.
found high predictive value of pyroglutamine, a glu-
tamine derivative [42]. Pathway analysis conducted by
each of the studies suggested that disrupted metabo-
lites may impact amino acid (mentioned in 4/5 stud-
ies) [17, 41, 42, 96] and/or energy metabolism pathways

Maksoud et al. BMC Medicine (2023) 21:189

(mentioned in 3/5 studies) potentially involving the
urea cycle [41, 42, 76]. ME/CFS patients have signifi-
cantly lower levels of phosphatidylcholine, choline and
carnitine compared to HC. ME/CFS patients with IBS
had significantly higher levels of triglyceride and cera-
mide [76].

Changes energy
metabolism in ME/CFS patients compared to HC were
investigated in four studies [28, 39, 73, 103]. Biologi-
cal antioxidant potential (BAP) measurements are pro-
portional to antioxidant capacity of a serum sample and
oxidative activity is determined through measuring dia-
cron reactive oxygen metabolites (d-ROMs) [39]. BAP,
d-ROMs, and oxidative stress index were all significantly
influenced by age. In the age-matched group, d-ROMs,
and oxidative stress index were significantly higher in
ME/CFS patients compared with HC. Further, work-
ers who experience sub-acute fatigue had significantly
higher values of d-ROMs, and OSI compared to HC and
ME/CFS patients at rest [39]. Domingo et al. reported
that ME/CFS patients had lower antioxidant capacity
and higher lipoperoxide, fibroblast growth factor 21, and
brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) [28]. Missailidis
et al. found that differences in mitochondrial respiratory
unction in combination with target of rapamycin com-
lex I activity and lymphocyte death rate can differenti-
ate ME/CFS patients from HC with a sensitivity of 90%
73). Sweetman et al. identified 60 differentially expressed
roteins in ME/CFS patients that have important roles in
mitochondrial and energy metabolism processes [103].
Four studies assessed differences in microbiome com-
osition of ME/CFS patients and HC [55, 66, 77, 95].
Mandarano et al. found that there were no differences
in eukaryotic diversity of gut microbiota in ME/CFS
atients compared with HC [66]. In stool and plasma
samples 72 h post-maximal exercise, there was an
increase in relative abundance in six (66.7%) major bacte-
rial phyla in ME/CFS compared with only two of the nine
in HC [95]. Clearance of these bacteria in blood was also
significantly slower in ME/CFS patients compared with
HC [95]. Nagy-Szakal et al. examined faecal metagen-
omic profiles in ME/CFS patients with or without IBS
compared with HC [77]. In general, ME/CFS patients had
lower metabolic pathways associated with unsaturated
fatty acid biosynthesis and increased atrazine degrada-
tion pathways independent of IBS comorbidity [77]. ME/
CFS patients with IBS had significantly higher unclassi-
fied allistripes and less Faecalibacterium compared with
HC. ME/CFS patients without IBS had greater unclassi-
fied Bacteroides and less Bacteroides Vulgatus [77].

Literature reporting on endovascular/circulatory
biomarkers

There were 13 studies that reported on endovascular/cir-
culatory biomarkers (Additional file 2, Table S4) [16, 19,
24, 30, 34, 35, 44, 47, 57, 58, 63, 70, 74, 85, 94, 100, 101,
105]. Endothelial function was assessed in two studies
47, 100]. Flow-mediated dilation (FMD) and post-occlu-
sive reactive hyperemia results suggest that endothelial
unction was much lower in ME/CFS patients compared
with HC [100]. Five out of 14 post COVID-19 ME/CFS
atients showed diminished reactive hyperaemia index
compared with HC [47]. Haffke et al. also reported ele-
vated endothelin-1 (ET-1) in ME/CFS patients and post
COVID-19 condition patients as well as lower angi-
opoietin-2 in both groups compared with HC [47]. Sor-
and et al. reported no differences in levels of markers of
endothelial function but the same metabolites as Haffke
et al. were not investigated [47, 100].

Circulating protein-level differences in ME/CFS
atients compared to HC were investigated in six stud-
ies [16, 44, 57, 58, 74, 105]. Serum activin B levels
were measured in three studies [44, 57, 58]. One study
reported no significant differences in activin B levels
between ME/CFS patients and HC [44]. Two studies by
Lidbury et al. found that serum activin B levels were sig-
nificantly higher in ME/CFS patients compared with HC
(57, 58]. Lidbury et al. also suggested that 24-h urinary
creatinine clearance and serum urea were also signifi-
cantly higher in ME/CFS patients [58]. Both studies were
reporting on the same study cohort [57, 58]. Lower lev-
els of serum creatine kinase in severe ME/CFS patients
compared with HC and non-severe ME/CFS patients
were described by Nacul et al. [74]. Significantly lower
creatine kinase was also described by Almenar-Pérez
et al. [16]. Thambirajah et al. found that basal HSP27 was
significantly higher in ME/CFS patients compared to HC
105]. Levels of HSP27, HSP60 and HSP90 were also sig-
nificantly decreased post-exercise in ME/CFS patients
compared to HC [105].

Lipid-based products were investigated in six studies
16, 19, 24, 30, 34, 85]. Nkiliza et al. investigated sex-spe-
cific differences in plasma lipid profiles [85]. Male ME/
CFS patients had significantly higher omega-6 linoleic
acid-derived oxylipins compared with female ME/CFS
atients [85]. Omega-6 linoleic acid-derived oxylipins
were significantly higher compared to male HC. In
emales, phosphatidylinositol, saturated triglyceride lev-
els and hexosylceramides were lower in ME/CFS patients
compared with HC [85]. Circulating EV was investigated
in four studies [16, 19, 24, 30]. Three studies found sig-
nificantly higher circulating EV numbers in ME/CFS
patients compared with HC [16, 24, 30]. Almenar-Pérez
et al. and Castro Marrero et al. also reported EVs smaller


--- Page 8 ---
Maksoud et al. BMC Medicine (2023) 21:189

in size [16, 24]. Additionally, Almenar-Pérez et al. found
that zeta-potential was significantly different in ME/CFS
patients compared to HC, where ME/CFS patients pre-
sented with more negative values regardless of whether
the EV were isolated in the presence or absence of pro-
teinase K [16]. Bonilla et al. found no association between
severe ME/CFS and levels of EVs carrying the B cell
marker CD19 and platelet marker CD41a [19]. Fenouil-
let et al. measured thiobarbituric acid reactive substances
(TBARS) and found that there were significant differ-
ences in this product in ME/CFS patients compared to
HC at rest [34]. During exercise, TBARS increased in
ME/CFS patients and positively correlated with CD26-
expression and negatively correlated with health-related
quality of life [34].

Circulating hormone or peptide levels were investi-
gated in five studies [35, 63, 70, 94, 101]. Shishioh-Ikejima
et al. measured differences in alpha-melanocyte-stim-
ulating hormone concentrations between ME/CFS
atients and HC [94]. ME/CFS patients had significantly
igher levels of alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone;
owever, this was negatively associated with duration of
illness [94]. Maes et al. found significantly lower serum
dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate (DHEAS) in ME/CFS
atients [63]. Growth/differentiation factor-15 (GDF15)
was found to be significantly higher in severe ME/CFS
atients compared with HC by Melvin et al. [70]. Circu-
ating levels of GDF15 was consistent across two different
time points in mild/moderate patients [70]. Stringer et al.
reported that fatigue severity significantly correlated with
eptin in ME/CFS patients [101]. Plasma neuropeptide Y
(NPY) was significantly higher in ME/CFS patients com-
ared to HC. NPY had significant associations with vari-
ous subjective measures including perceived stress and
depression levels [35].

Literature reporting on neurological biomarkers

There were eight studies reporting on neurological
changes in ME/CFS patients compared with HC (Addi-
tional File 2, Table S5) [69, 79, 86, 89, 90, 93, 106, 112].
Two studies reported on ventricular lactate and levels
were significantly higher in ME/CFS patients compared
with HC [69, 79]. Functional connectivity differences in
ME/CFS patients compared with HC were described in
two studies [90, 93]. Shan et al. described higher com-
plexity in ME/CFS patients in the default mode network
while performing a stroop task [93]. The posterior cin-
gulate cortex showed more complex blood oxygenation
level-dependent (BOLD) signals in both the resting state
and during a task compared with HC [93]. Rayhan et al.
found that ME/CFS patients had lower BOLD signals
compared with HC; however, following exercise, there
was an increase in spontaneous activity in the anterior

node of the default mode network in ME/CFS patients.
All other studies reported on different neurological
parameters [90]. Thapaliya et al. found that there were no
significant changes in axial and mean diffusivity between
FC ME/CFS patients and HC [106]. However, differences
were found in ICC ME/CFS patients compared with HC
in the descending cortico-cerebellar tract in the mid-
brain and pons [106]. Zeineh et al. found that bilateral
white matter volumes were significantly lower in ME/
CFS patients [112]. White matter microstructure disrup-
tions in the right arcuate fasciculus were also identified
{112]. Okada et al. reported that grey matter volumes
were significantly reduced in the bilateral prefrontal
cortex in people with ME/CFS compared with HC [86].
Provenzano et al. used a machine learning methodol-
ogy based on 10 functional magnetic resonance imaging
regions including but not limited to putamen, inferior
frontal gyrus, orbital and supramarginal gyrus which was
able to effectively differentiate between ME/CFS patients
and HC (Pre-exercise day 1: Sensitivity =87.5%; Specific-
ity=76.9%; Accuracy = 80.9%; post-exercise day 2: Sensi-
tivity = 76.9%; Specificity =75%; Accuracy = 76.1%) [89].

Literature reporting on ion channel biomarkers

Nine studies reported changes in TRP, nociceptor or adr-
energic receptors (Additional File 2, Table S6) [23, 29, 52,
59, 60, 67, 68, 83, 111]. Six studies were previously men-
tioned in the genetic/epigenetic section. [52, 59, 60, 67,
68, 111].

Three studies reported on TRPM3 function in NK
cells [23, 29, 83]. Nguyen et al’s study reported lower
surface expression of TRPM3 receptors in unstimulated
CD56""8""CD16%™- NK cells as well as no significant
differences in Ca** influx into the cell [23]. In contrast,
cpD56"8""CD16%"- NK cells stimulated with pregne-
nolone sulfate (PregS) have significantly higher Ca*t
influx in ME/CFS compared with HC [23]. Cabanas et al.
found lower TRPM3 currents following PregS stimula-
tion [23]. Ca?* influx through TRPM3 was also signifi-
cantly lower in ME/CFS as described by Eaton-Fitch et al.
[29].

Literature reporting on physical biomarkers

In total, nine studies used physical based biomarkers
(Additional File 2, Table $7) [15, 31, 34, 38, 40, 75, 80, 81,
98]. Heart rate markers were reported in seven studies
[15, 31, 38, 40, 80, 81, 98]. Heart rate variability (HRV)
was measured in three studies [31, 38, 40]. Gao et al.
found that there was significantly higher heart rate vari-
ability (HRV) in ME/CFS patients compared with HC at
baseline; however, when exposed to a stress test, there
was no significant differences in HRV between the groups
[40]. In a study by Frith et al, HRV was significantly

--- Page 9 ---
Maksoud et al. BMC Medicine (2023) 21:189

increased higher in ME/CFS patients compared to HC
at rest while parasympathetic markers were significantly
lower [38]. Escorihuela et al. also assessed HRV at rest
and found ME/CFS patients had decreased intervals
between consecutive heartbeats (RR) in addition to HRV
time and frequency-domain parameters compared with
HC [31]. There was a significant association between RR
scores and self-reported fatigue. Nelson et al. reported
that there was lower post-exercise heart rate recovery in
ME/CFS patients compared with HC [80]. In an earlier
publication by the same author, work rate at ventilatory
threshold was found to be lower in ME/CFS patients by
6.3—9.8% compared to HC on day 2 of CPET [81]. Snell
et al. conducted two replicate analyses measuring lower
workload in ME/CFS patients compared to HC. Test two
showed that at peak exercise and ventilatory or anaero-
bic threshold, ME/CFS had significantly lower workload;
however, test one showed no significant differences [98].
Allen et al. reported that overall pulse-timing response
to controlled standing across all sites was significantly
reduced in ME/CFS patients [15].

Nacul et al. assessed hand-grip strength differences
between ME/CFS patients and HC [75]. Mild/mod-
erate ME/CFS patients had a significant reduction of
hand-grip strength (HGS) to 10.5 kg, and severe ME/
CFS patients were associated with a reduction of HGS to
approximately 15.3 kg [75]. These parameters correlated
with clinical parameters such as disease severity, fatigue
and pain analogue scale and physical component sum-
mary [75].

Quality analysis

Quality of each included publication was assessed using
the JBI CACCCS. Full results and justification can be
found in Additional File 3. Six studies appropriately
addressed all quality criteria [29, 50, 56, 95, 106, 115]. All
studies assessed outcomes in a standard, valid and reli-
able way for both ME/CFS patients and HC (CACCCS
criteria item 8). All papers provided appropriate justifica-
tion for tools used to measure outcomes [15-115]. Poten-
tial confounding factors were appropriately identified in
81.18% of the studies [15-20, 22-32, 34-40, 43, 45, 47-
52, 55-64, 66—70, 72-81, 83-90, 92, 93, 95, 96, 99-101,
103-106, 108-112, 115]. In most cases where confound-
ing factors were identified, the researchers were able to
mitigate or control for them (80%) [15—20, 22-32, 34—40,
43, 45, 47-52, 55-64, 66-70, 72-81, 83-90, 92, 93, 95,
99-101, 104-106, 108-112, 115]. ME/CFS patients were
appropriately matched with HC in 67.33% of the stud-
ies [15-17, 19, 23-25, 27-31, 36-38, 40-43, 46, 48, 50,
51, 53-56, 60-62, 64-70, 72, 73, 76-79, 82, 84, 85, 87,
89, 91, 94-96, 98, 99, 101-103, 105, 106, 108-113, 115].
The least addressed CACCCs item was checklist item 2:

adequate matching of source population which was only
achieved by 26.7% [21, 22, 25, 27-31, 43, 50, 51, 56-58,
64, 72, 76, 77, 83, 95, 102, 106, 107, 109, 110, 113, 115].
In total, 36.6% of studies selected appropriate statistical
analysis [16, 18, 20, 23-25, 29, 35, 42, 44, 45, 47, 49-51,
55, 56, 66, 68, 94, 95, 99, 101, 104, 106, 114, 115]. There
were 23 (22.8%) studies that included an exposure [15,
32, 34, 38, 40, 57-60, 70, 75, 80-82, 84, 89, 90, 93, 95, 99,
105, 111]. The exposure was measured in a standard and
valid way in 100% of the studies. The exposure was also
measured consistently across patients and HC [15, 32, 34,
38, 40, 57-60, 70, 75, 80-82, 84, 89, 90, 93, 95, 99, 105,
111] and the duration was sufficient to show an effect in
95.7% of studies [15, 32, 34, 38-40, 57-60, 70, 75, 80-82,
84, 89, 90, 93, 95, 98, 99, 105].

Discussion

Although there is no consensus on a biomarker for ME/
CFS, several markers have been suggested as potential
candidates. The aim of this systematic review was to col-
late and appraise available literature on suggested bio-
markers for ME/CFS.

This systematic review used “biomarker” keywords in
the abstract and title to determine the search. Therefore,
the only articles that were retrieved were limited to those
that specifically contained the keywords as according to
Cochrane’s guidelines [12]. Studies that did not contain
the specific keywords but may investigate related bio-
markers therefore may not have been included in the
search. This study, however, gives an overview of poten-
tial biomarkers in the field of ME/CFS.

Females were more prominent across the studies
where 76% of the ME/CFS patients and 72% of the HC
were female. In literature, ME/CFS is more commonly
reported in females [116]. There is limited understanding
as to what mechanism is contributing to sex-specific dif-
ferences. Only one included study investigated potential
factors influencing female predominance in epidemiolog-
ical datasets through analysis of lipid profiles in male and
female ME/CFS patients [41]. Although this study found
significant differences, these were against all HC not ME/
CFS females; therefore, they did not appropriately con-
trol for sex-related differences [41].

Majority of the participants in this review are diag-
nosed according to FC [15, 19, 21, 22, 24, 28, 31, 35-42,
44, 45, 49, 50, 52, 53, 59, 61-69, 71, 78, 79, 83, 84, 86-89,
92-95, 98, 99, 101, 102, 105, 108, 111-115]. The predomi-
nance of the FC use in biomarker studies is a limitation as
this criteria is broad in nature and has considerable over-
lap with other illnesses [6]. There was a shift in criteria
used over time, where the much broader FC is phasing
out in more recent studies for more stringent definitions
CCC and ICC. This is due to the CCC now replacing FC

Maksoud et al. BMC Medicine (2023) 21:189

as the internationally recognised definition for both clini-
cal and research use [5]. Evidence of necessity for appro-
priately selected stringent definitions for detection of
biomarkers can be shown in Thapaliya et al. who reported
significant differences in patients diagnosed according
to ICC criteria [106]. There were no significant clusters
found between ME/CFS patients diagnosed according to
FC [106]. This indicates that stratifying patients accord-
ing to case criteria may allow for additional meaningful
observations to be made.

ME/CFS is a multifactorial condition that is also often
associated with comorbid conditions including, but
not limited to, IBS and fibromyalgia. Presence of multi-
ple comorbidities complicates determining a biomarker
specific for ME/CFS. Where possible, stratification of
patients with and without comorbidities may assist with
further understanding ME/CFS-specific pathomecha-
nisms. Furthermore, there are other illnesses that are
currently only diagnosed with case criteria and have sig-
nificant symptom and pathological overlap with ME/CFS
such as Gulf War illness [90]. Inclusion of both patient
groups supports further discernment of both pathologies.
In one of the included studies in this review, some post
COVID-19 patients met the definition of ME/CFS. Both
post COVID-19 patients with and without ME/CFS dem-
onstrated elevated levels of ET-1 compared with HC [47].
Haffke et al. did not include ME/CFS patients that did
not develop ME/CFS post COVID-19; however, whether
ET-1 levels were associated with COVID-19 or related to
ME/CFS too is unclear. With significant overlap, assess-
ing similar ME/CFS markers in post COVID-19 condi-
tion is important to allow understanding of association
or differentiation of the condition [47].

Appropriate selection criteria of HC are a necessary
experimental consideration. There were two studies that
investigated pathology in ME/CFS patients and blood-
related relatives compared with HC [102, 109]. Impor-
tantly, Tokunaga et al. indicated significant differences
in a number of non-classical monocytes between ME/
CFS patients and non-affected blood relatives compared
with non-related HC [109]. Sung et al. also reported
that ME/CFS patients and non-affected blood relatives
showed lower ADCC compared with non-affected HC
[102]. These results show the importance of having well-
matched non-related HC, as even asymptomatic relatives
of those with ME/CFS may display physiological differ-
ences from non-related HC. Nineteen studies involved
the recruitment of sedentary controls [31, 32, 35, 38,
48, 59, 65, 75, 80, 81, 84, 85, 89, 90, 98, 102, 105, 109].
Buford et al. highlighted that selection of sedentary con-
trols introduces bias and may interfere with delineating
between patients and healthy patients [117].

The majority of the biomarkers were blood-based.
Blood-based biomarkers are recognised as accessible,
direct and non-invasive, especially in at-risk populations.
Importantly, condition of the blood or blood product is
important to consider. Recovery of frozen lymphocyte
samples resulted in reduced viability [73]. This result is
supported by Mata et al. which found that frozen/over-
night rested PBMC had higher antibody-dependent cell-
mediated cytotoxicity and NK activity compared to fresh
PBMC [118]. It is important that in vitro studies closely
represent true in vivo biological processes.

There were 20 studies that investigated genetic and epi-
genetic changes in ME/CFS patients compared with HC
[16, 18, 20, 21, 25, 27, 43, 52, 59, 60, 67, 68, 71, 82, 87,
88, 92, 108, 103, 111]. Many of these studies were inde-
pendent, association studies and investigated changes in
either different cell or tissue types; therefore, it was dif-
ficult to make comparisons. However, there is significant
evidence of a genetic component of ME/CFS [16, 18, 20,
21, 25, 27, 43, 52, 59, 60, 67, 68, 71, 82, 87, 88, 92, 108,
111]. Only two studies investigated sequence differences
through SNPs in ME/CFS patients compared with HC.
These studies found significant SNP variants in TRP and
mAChRs genes [67, 68]. Other ion channel abnormali-
ties further downstream have been identified including
increased expression of purinergic and cellular modula-
tors, sensory and adrenergic receptors [52, 59, 60, 111].
MiR-21 was reported on in three studies. MiR-21 is a
highly conserved, non-specific marker implicated in at
least 29 diseases as reported by Jenike et al. [119]. There-
fore, due to its association with many other diseases,
miR-21 is not a suitable distinguishing biomarker. The
emergence of whole genome sequencing may allow for a
more comprehensive high-throughput characterisation
of genome changes in ME/CFS patients compared with
HC in contrast to association studies; however, there are
significant cost ramifications for its use in laboratory or
clinical settings [120].

Immune dysfunction was the most prevalent biomarker
type investigated in the included publications. Among
these studies supporting immune dysfunction, there were
five that investigated NKCC [37, 65, 67, 107, 114]. NKCC
and function were significantly reduced in ME/CFS
patients compared with HC, this corroborates with find-
ings in an individual systematic review on ME/CFS and
NK cell cytotoxicity and phenotype by Eaton-Fitch et al.
[121]. Cliff et al. found no difference in NKCC; however,
it is difficult to compare these studies as there was sig-
nificant differences in methodology including the use of
freeze-thawed samples in contrast to freshly isolated NK
cells [26]. Theorell et al. also found no differences in cyto-
toxic NK cell phenotype and function; however, these
experiments were also conducted on freeze-thawed cells

--- Page 11 ---
Maksoud et al. BMC Medicine (2023) 21:189

with 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) [107]. DMSO has
been shown to be toxic to cells at even lower doses < 10%
[122]. Therefore, use of DMSO in higher concentrations
is a significant limitation. These investigations were also
only conducted on PBMCs and not directly on isolated
lymphocytes. Brenu et al. conducted a longitudinal
investigation on NKCC in ME/CFS patients compared
to HC. Although the level of NKCC in ME/CFS fluctu-
ates, NKCC is consistently reduced over time [114]. The
consistency of NK cell pathology across multiple stud-
ies and over time as well as the accessibility of NK cells
suggests that it is an effective model to investigate the
pathomechanism of ME/CFS. There is insufficient evi-
dence to suggest ME/CFS is an inflammatory or auto-
immune disorder. Instead, there was evidence of both
disrupted innate and acquired immune systems suggest-
ing inflammation may be a secondary characteristic in
response to cellular and immune dysregulation due to the
cell’s reduced capacity to respond to the alert given off
by inflammatory markers. van Eeden et al. reported that
intensity of inflammation was associated with a decrease
in NK cells in COVID-19 patients [123]. NK cell effector
function was also significantly compromised in COVID-
19 patients [123, 124].

Cabanas et al. and Eaton-Fitch et al. assessed potential
physiological processes underlying NK cell dysfunction
including measurement of TRPM3 ionic currents and
Ca?* influx in NK cells from ME/CES patients compared
to HC [23, 29]. These authors emphasised the impor-
tance of the second messenger Ca”* in regulating NK
cell function and maintenance of cellular homeostasis.
In contrast, Nguyen et al. did not show any significant
differences in Ca** influx through TRPM3 in ME/CFS
patients compared to HC; however, this was potentially
due to interfering small inward currents activated by
PregS through the flow cytometry technique which was
not apparent in the confocal microscopy approach [83].
Patch clamp offers a highly sensitive method to measure
Ca?* influx. While patch clamp is the gold standard for
investigating ion channel physiology, it can be conducted
complimentary with confocal live imaging. TRP channels
are also stress-activated including infection. ME/CFS
development post-infection was described in three of
the included studies [47-49]. An epidemiology study by
Chu et al. identified that approximately 64% of patients
reported an infectious onset preceding development of
ME/CFS [125].

Three studies described changes in mitochondria [73,
96, 113]. Most of the metabolomic studies were most
associated with changes in amino acids and energy
metabolism. There was evidence of mitochondrial physi-
ological changes in ME/CFS patients compared with
HC; however, there were very few corroborated findings

Page 11 of 18

across the included studies in this review [73, 96, 113].
A systematic review by Holden et al. investigated mito-
chondrial dysfunction in ME/CFS patients. This review
found that there was minimal indication that there is
disruption of mitochondrial genes [126]. Primary mito-
chondrial defects or mitochondrial disease are associated
with multi-system manifestations and often result in res-
piratory failure and high morbidity [127]. To the best of
the authors’ knowledge, respiratory failure has not been
described in ME/CFS patients.

Neurological changes in ME/CFS were investigated
in eight of the included studies [69, 79, 86, 89, 90, 93,
106, 112]. The major characteristics that were found was
that the activity of the brain of patients was more com-
plex; however, functional connectivity was weaker in
ME/CFS patients and this is associated with cognitive
difficulties. Evidence of neuroinflammation through ele-
vated ventricular lactate concentrations were observed;
however, as shown by Natelson, there was no significant
differences between ME/CFS, fibromyalgia and comorbid
ME/CFS and fibromyalgia groups. Therefore, inflamma-
tion of the brain may not be a sufficient biomarker on its
own as it is characteristic and non-differentiated between
other overlapping conditions [79].

Many of these biomarkers were studied in isolation but
may be part of a complex multidisciplinary process as
displayed by some of the overlap between observations
made and extensive crosstalk between each system. There
is evidence of widespread genetic, immune, neurologi-
cal, mitochondrial and endocrine differences in ME/CFS
compared with HC. Genetic abnormalities lead physi-
ological disruption at the cellular and tissue level. Poten-
tial linking pathways have been described in Fig. 2. Some
studies also showed multiple layers of evidence through
use of different techniques to validate the same find-
ing, for example TRPM3 dysfunction was demonstrated
in various ways including genetic SNPs, genotypes, cell
electrophysiology, and Ca?* influx (9, 18, 61, 62, 77].

Use of exercise to promote PEM was commonly used
in some studies. There are significant limitations to use of
exercise to stimulate and measure biological changes in
ME/CFS patients. The studies also do not cater for poten-
tial delays in onset of PEM where some patients reported
symptoms presenting post 24 h. In many cases, inducing
PEM through exercise requires specialised equipment
and transport of patients to specific locations in order to
collect data and many patients are unable to participate
due to the severity of their illness. There is also a trade-off
for specificity in all studies, for example Frith et al. had a
sensitivity of 77% but a specificity of 53% [38]. Many ME/
CFS patients will experience exercise intolerance but not
everyone with exercise intolerance has ME/CFS. Exercise
testing fell under the complex and indirect biomarker

Fig. 2 Postulated multidisciplinary pathway of ME/CFS. ME/CFS onset often occurs following an environmental trigger/s such as infection, trauma
or chemical insult. ME/CFS is associated with genetic changes including SNPs in TRP and CHRM that are critical in cell signalling processes. In a
two-step process, environmental triggers may result in upregulation of defected proteins that participate in these pathways and disruption of
downstream signalling pathways involved in natural killer cell cytotoxicity and mitochondrial regulation. This can either directly affect different
tissues and systems or indirectly through inflammatory pathways and cytokines. Cytokines and inflammation trigger epigenetic changes through

Most of these biomarkers fall under “moderate to Weigl described the importance of a biomarker’s ability to

of the biomarker from laboratory to more automated eral pathogens that have been attributed to the onset of

Maksoud et al. BMC Medicine (2023) 21:189

ME/CFS [10]. Cytokines and circulatory markers such
as hormones were investigated in many of the included
studies and are “tertiary” biomarkers. These markers are
produced via an immune response and are transient or
variable and therefore often unstable as diagnostic tar-
gets. Two studies had “primary” markers that identified a
disease-causing agent [48, 97]. Onset of ME/CFS through
various infectious agents have been described and use of
these markers provide valuable insight on mechanisms
underlying different onsets, but are limited as a diagnos-
tic tool [125].

Integration of machine learning algorithms with the
development of biomarkers will allow to assess a model
for classification and feature selection. With machine
learning, you can select multiple strong candidates for
ME/CFS and train the software to recognise these pat-
terns and appropriately classify patients and HC with
great sensitivity, specificity and accuracy as described by
Missailidis et al. [73]. In this study, the authors combined
all three assays: frozen lymphocyte death rate, lympho-
blast mitochondrial dysfunction, and lymphoblast Target
Of Rapamycin Complex 1 (TORC1) signalling which on
their own were not outstanding discriminators; however,
combining them gave an accuracy of 95% in determining
ME/CFS patients from HC and a sensitivity of 97% and a
specificity of 100% [73].

Stability is an important component when consider-
ing biomarkers. In some of the biomarkers investigated,
changes in certain parameters were influenced by ill-
ness severity, illness duration, and onset patterns such
as infectious onset and time [18, 70, 72, 74, 75, 100].
Although these investigations are useful in understand-
ing the pathomechanism occurring at different stages
and presentations as well as stratification of patients, a
diagnostic biomarker should be universal and applicable
despite these factors. Incorporation of a mixed disease
population representative of the ME/CFS community in
cases where illness is heterogenous is important. Longi-
tudinal investigations are critical for understanding the
stability of the biomarker over time [114]. There were
only two studies that investigated biomarkers longitu-
dinally, one that measured NK cell subtypes iNKT and
NKG2D and one that investigated NKCC over time [114,
115].

Many of the studies investigated were standalone stud-
ies with insufficient or proof-of-concept sample sizes.
It is difficult to compare studies of the same marker as
their methodology varied significantly including cell or
tissue type. Some studies implemented two phases, dis-
covery and validation phase and this process was effec-
tive in demonstrating test-test reproducibility. In some
cases, the sample sizes are relatively small; however,

Page 13 of 18

reproducibility is also demonstrated through assessing
many individual cells across multiple samples and shows
robustness between and within samples [23, 29, 83].

Quality analysis

Levels of quality varied across the included papers, with
six studies appropriately addressing all quality criteria
[29, 50, 56, 95, 106, 115]. All studies assessed outcomes
in a standard, valid and reliable way for both ME/CFS
patients and HC (CACCCS criteria item 8); this is often
through use of validated experimental tools. All papers
provided appropriate justification for tools used to meas-
ure outcomes including, but not limited to, flow cytom-
etry to heart rate monitors [15-115]. ME/CFS patients
and HC were matched in various ways most predomi-
nantly age and sex, however, also through BMI and race.
In most cases where a confounding factor was identi-
fied, the researchers were able to mitigate or control for
potential confounding variables using a variety of meth-
ods including exclusion, a washout period for medication
or statistical adjustment for cofactors [15—20, 22-32, 34—
40, 43, 45, 47-52, 55-64, 66-70, 72-81, 83-90, 92, 93,
95, 99-101, 104-106, 108-112, 115]. The least addressed
CACCCs item was checklist item 2: adequate matching
of source population [21, 22, 25, 27-31, 43, 50, 51, 56-58,
64, 72, 76, 77, 83, 95, 102, 106, 107, 109, 110, 113, 115].
Appropriate matching of sociodemographic characteris-
tics through recruitment of matched participants from
similar geographical regions is critical to eliminate poten-
tial sources of bias. Additionally, inclusion of power-
based sample sizes, normality testing and adjustments for
multiple comparisons is also necessary to ensure accurate
and representative statistical outputs.

Conclusions

There is currently no consensus on a biomarker for ME/
CFS; however, there is significant body of biological
evidence demonstrating that ME/CFS results in wide-
spread immunological disruption. Effective biomarkers
are accessible and have strong sensitivity, specificity and
selectivity to detect disease targets. Additionally, having
multiple layers of evidence such as genetic and physi-
ological high test-test reproducibility of results is para-
mount. The included studies ranged in efficacy, quality,
and potential to be developed into a diagnostic bio-
marker. This review also corroborates the use of NK cells
as a suitable model to investigate the pathomechanism
of this illness due to the consistency observed over time.
This systematic review identifies potential associations
between the findings and highlights that these systems do
not work independently and rather they could be part of
a complex integrative network. The heterogeneity shown

across many of the included studies highlights the need
for multidisciplinary research and uniform protocols in
ME/CFS biomarker research.

Abstract

Post-acute COVID-19 syndrome (PACS) has been defined as symptoms persisting after clearance of a COVID-19 infec-
tion. We have previously demonstrated that alterations in DNA methylation (DNAm) status persist in individuals who
recovered from a COVID-19 infection, but it is currently unknown if PACS is associated with epigenetic changes. We
compared DNAm patterns in patients with PACS with those in controls and in healthy COVID-19 convalescents and
found a unique DNAm signature in PACS patients. This signature unravelled modified pathways that regulate angio-
tensin Il and muscarinic receptor signalling and protein-protein interaction networks that have bearings on vesicle

formation and mitochondrial function.

Introduction

In some individuals, the acute phase of COVID-19 causes
lethal disease, while others may experience only mild
symptoms or remain asymptomatic. Also, in those with
a mild course of infection, complications may persist
after clearance of infection. Symptoms continuing more
than 4 weeks after the infection have been defined as
long-term complications of COVID-19, while symptoms
persisting beyond more than 12 weeks are often referred
to as “Post-acute COVID-19 Syndrome” (PACS) [1].
Commonly reported PACS symptoms include, but are
not limited to, physiological (muscle weakness, exercise
intolerance, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome,

palpitations, dyspnoea, dry cough, chest pain, loss of
smell and taste), psychiatric (insomnia, anxiety, depres-
sion, nightmares) and/or cognitive dysfunction (fatigue,
memory problems, light sensitivity, sleep disturbances)
{1]. The discussion about symptom subgroups in PACS
is ongoing, where grouping based on affected organ(s)
has been proposed. Symptoms can fluctuate, persist or
fade over time. A correlation between disease severity
during the acute infection and PACS has been reported
{1], though not limited to severe infection. Currently, the
pathophysiological mechanisms underlying PACS remain
largely unknown.

Recently, we demonstrated that healthy COVID-19
convalescents carry a distinct DNA methylation (DNAm)
pattern in their peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMC) without any shifts in PBMC cell population fre-
quencies [2]. The aim of the current study was to further
elucidate the DNAm pattern of PACS patients, by com-
paring DNAm in PBMC from PACS patients, healthy
COVID-19 convalescents (CC19) and controls (Con).

Methods

We recruited 10 study subjects between 27 and 57 years
of age referred to the Department of Clinical Physiology
at Linképing University Hospital due to persistent PACS
symptoms for more than 12 weeks. The PACS patients
had either a previous positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2
and/or reported symptoms consistent with COVID-19
infection that affected daily life. The PACS group pre-
sented with a wide range of symptoms (Additional file 1:
Table Sla) and received no hospital care in the acute
COVID-19 infection. 7 out of 10 subjects were vacci-
nated against COVID-19 with Comirnaty (Pfizer/BioN-
Tech)<4 months prior to inclusion. DNA methylation
data from a previous study [2] and serology data from
an ongoing study (manuscript in preparation) with sub-
jects who did not report any remaining symptoms after
an episode of mild or moderate symptoms of COVID-19
(CC19) along with a matched control group (Con) were
used for comparison [2]. CC19s and Cons were collected
during spring/summer of 2020. None of the CC19 or
Cons (from the previous study) was vaccinated (no vac-
cines available at that time) (Table S1b) [2]. PBMCs were
isolated from 30 ml peripheral blood collected in EDTA
tubes and DNA was prepared as described previously [2].
The DNAm analysis was run with the Illumina Infinium
Methylation EPIC 850 K BeadChip array (Illumina Inc,
San Diego, USA) by the core facility for Bioinformatics
and Expression Analysis at Karolinska Institute, Stock-
holm, Sweden. Bioinformatic analysis was performed
(Additional file 1: Supplementary Methods). Suspension
multiplex immunoassay (SMIA) analysis for antibodies
against CHRM3 in plasma was performed as previously
described [2] using human Muscarinic acetylcholine
receptor M3 recombinant protein (#MBS955742, My
Biosource).

Results

The data from the PACS patients were compared to the
existing data from our previous study [2] on convales-
cent COVID-19 in which inclusions were done during
2020. The mean PACS symptom duration was 46 weeks
(17-66) at the time of inclusion. Statistical comparisons
of demographic variables (Additional file 1: Table S1b)
revealed no significant differences between the study
groups. The PACS subjects all had significant levels of
anti-RBD antibodies. PACS samples had significantly
stronger IgG responses against SARS-CoV-2 RBD com-
pared to the CC19 group.

Of the initial methylation analyses of 865,918 probes,
813,467 probes remained upon filtering with two samples
removed due to low quality probes. Multidimensional
scaling (MDS) analysis (Fig. 1a) demonstrated that the
three groups formed separate clusters, apart from one

PACS patient clustering among the CC19 and Con sub-
jects. The cell proportion estimate indicated higher pro-
portion of neutrophils (¢ test p value<0.01) in the PACS
group, compared to the other two groups (Additional
file 1: Table S2).

We then proceeded to identify differentially methyl-
ated CpGs (DMCs) by comparing the PACS group to the
CC19 and Con groups, using a threshold of <0.05 (FDR-
adjusted p-value) and a mean methylation difference
(MMD) cut-off of >0.2. (Additional file 1: Fig. $1). We
observed 197 (65% hypermethylated) and 98 (57% hyper-
methylated) DMCs when comparing the PACS indi-
viduals’ DNA methylome to the CC19 and Con groups,
respectively (Additional file 1: Table S3, Additional file 2:
Table $4). We combined the DMCs from the above analy-
sis and generated a heatmap of individual B values of the
271 identified DMCs (Fig. 1b). Each of the DMCs were
mapped to their corresponding differentially methylated
genes (DMGs) (Additional file 2: Table S4a, b) and the B
values of three DMCs selected by significant differences
between all groups were mapped to the genes SNORD3B,
CETP and DLGAP1 are shown in Fig. 1c. Panther path-
way enrichment analysis (Fig. 2a) revealed significantly
enriched pathways including “Angiotensin II-stimulated

signalling through G proteins and f-arrestin’, “Histamine
H1 receptor mediated signalling pathway’, “Heterotrim-
eric G-protein signalling pathway-Gq alpha and Go alpha
mediated pathway’, “PI3 kinase pathway” and “Mus-
carinic acetylcholine receptor 1 and 3 (CHRM1&3) sig-
nalling pathway” (Fig. 2a). Since autoantibodies against
different G-coupled receptors have been described in
PACS [3], we assessed auto-antibodies in plasma of sub-
jects from the previous cohort [2] and the PACS sub-
jects of the present study. Three of the PACS subjects
had increased plasma levels of CHRM3-specific IgG
(Fig. 2b) but not IgM or auto-antibodies directed towards
62-adrenergic receptors (data not shown).

We found that 38 of the identified DMGs were repre-
sented among the 5221 proteins that were known to be
exploited by SARS-CoV-2 (Additional file 1: Fig. $2).
Exploration of protein-protein interactions (PPI) to
detect possible modules among these 38 DMGs revealed
that most of the proteins were connected in a PPI net-
work (Fig. 2c). PACSIN2 interacts with both the M (mem-
brane) and N (nucleocapsid) proteins of SARS-CoV-2
and is a membrane-binding protein involved in vesicle
formation. PACSIN2 also interacts with the ACE2 recep-
tor (www.thebiogrid.org), which SARS-CoV-2 exploits
for entry into cells. A regulatory module including the
GTP-binding protein GNB1 (which is a central compo-
nent of all five pathways listed in Fig. 2a) is linking PAC-
SIN2 to an actin-nucleating module of ARP2/3 proteins.
PIGG is an enzyme involved in membrane lipid anchor

Discussion

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of
epigenome-wide DNAm alterations in subjects with
PACS. We and others have studied DNA methyla-
tion changes in response to acute COVID-19 [4] and in

healthy recoverees after the acute phase [2]. The CpG
sites with the most pronounced changes compar-
ing PACS with CC19 were found in genes encoding
SNORD3B, CETP and DLGAP. SNORD3B belongs to a
family of small nucleolar RNAs that have been suggested

Nikesjo et al. Clinical Epigenetics (2022) 14:172

to be exploited by RNA viruses [5]. CETP is a cholesterol
metabolizing enzyme and CETP-inhibitors have been
proposed as treatment option for COVID-19 [6]. DLGAP
is a postsynaptic protein that binds dynein (DYNLL1),
which in turns binds no less than 10 SARS-CoV-2 pro-
teins. Several of the pathways that we found epigeneti-
cally modulated in PACS subjects, including Angiotensin
II receptor, muscarinic receptors and histamine signal-
ling pathways, are relevant for the symptomatic picture
of PACS. Angiotensin II has been shown to regulate the
expression of ACE2 in neurons and SARS-CoV-2 binds
to the ACE2 receptor via the S (spike) protein to enter
cells. Histamines have been demonstrated to play a role
in PACS, as partial symptom relief was reported in PACS
patients upon treatment with antihistamines [7]. The
pathways regulated by muscarinic receptors CHRM1&3
play a role in odour perception and were found to be
epigenetically modulated in patients with PACS. Auto-
antibodies towards GPCR have been demonstrated in
chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) [8] and a recent review
lists a number of auto-antibodies targeting GPCRs that
were identified also in PACS [3]. We found a tendency of
increased levels of CHRM3-specific IgG autoantibodies
in our PACS cohort. Functionally active auto-antibodies
are known to disturb the balance of neuronal and vas-
cular activity and in fact, extracorporeal apheresis could
reduce levels of autoantibodies and alleviate symptoms
of CFS in a recent PACS study [9]. The finding of epige-
netic modulation of the pathways of the same receptors
for which auto-antibodies are described in PACS and
CFS is intriguing and raises the question of a possible
mechanistic relationship. Hypothetically, as part of the
anti-viral defense, the host could down-modulate (either
by creating autoantibodies or epigenetically) pathways
exploited by the virus, which when they become persis-
tently downregulated after viral clearance, may contrib-
ute to impairment of cellular functions. In line with this
idea, the PPI modules that we found to be epigenetically
modulated include cellular processes that are central to
vesicle formation, exemplified by the identified connec-
tion of PACSIN2 and sub-membrane actin remodeling
(ARP2/3), which potentially contributes to the forma-
tion of new virus particles. Another identified module
with very strong interactions with SARS-CoV-2 involves
NDUFA proteins, which regulate the NADH oxidase in
mitochondria. Mitochondrial dysfunction was recently
described in PACS [10] and our finding of an epigeneti-
cally modified module at the core of mitochondrial func-
tion warrants further investigation in PACS. We cannot
exclude the possibility that the PACS specific epigenetic
signature is driven by a hidden SARS-CoV-2 reservoir.
Studies including the epigenetic background and sig-
natures in other than post viral fatigue syndromes are

needed. The impact of vaccination on DNAm profiles is
not possible to determine in the current study and should
be evaluated in future analyses. In summary, although
limited by the number of subjects included and without
information on the stability of the DNAm signature, the
results of the present pilot study can generate hypotheses
that may help to explain the pathophysiological mecha-
nisms underlying PACS. Hopefully, this could accelerate
the development of preventive strategies and therapeutic
options for PACS, which likely will persist longer than
the COVID-19 pandemic itself.

The host epigenetic landscape rapidly changes during SARS-CoV-2 infection, and
evidence suggest that severe COVID-19 is associated with durable scars to the
epigenome. Specifically, aberrant DNA methylation changes in immune cells and
alterations to epigenetic clocks in blood relate to severe COVID-19. However, a
longitudinal assessment of DNA methylation states and epigenetic clocks in blood
from healthy individuals prior to and following test-confirmed non-hospitalized COVID-
19 has not been performed. Moreover, the impact of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines upon the
host epigenome remains understudied. Here, we first examined DNA methylation states in
the blood of 21 participants prior to and following test-confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis at a
median time frame of 8.35 weeks; 756 CpGs were identified as differentially methylated
following COVID-19 diagnosis in blood at an FDR adjusted p-value < 0.05. These CpGs
were enriched in the gene body, and the northern and southern shelf regions of genes
involved in metabolic pathways. Integrative analysis revealed overlap among genes
identified in transcriptional SARS-CoV-2 infection datasets. Principal component-based
epigenetic clock estimates of PhenoAge and GrimAge significantly increased in people
over 50 following infection by an average of 2.1 and 0.84 years. In contrast, PCPhenoAge
significantly decreased in people fewer than 50 following infection by an average of
2.06 years. This observed divergence in epigenetic clocks following COVID-19 was related
to age and immune cell-type compositional changes in CD4* T cells, B cells, granulocytes,
plasmablasts, exhausted T cells, and naive T cells. Complementary longitudinal epigenetic
clock analyses of 36 participants prior to and following Pfizer and Moderna mRNA-based
COVID-19 vaccination revealed that vaccination significantly reduced principal
component-based Horvath epigenetic clock estimates in people over 50 by an
average of 3.91 years for those who received Moderna. This reduction in epigenetic

clock estimates was significantly related to chronological age and immune cell-type
compositional changes in B cells and plasmablasts pre- and post-vaccination. These
findings suggest the potential utility of epigenetic clocks as a biomarker of COVID-19
vaccine responses. Future research will need to unravel the significance and durability of
short-term changes in epigenetic age related to COVID-19 exposure and mRNA

vaccination.

INTRODUCTION

Epigenetic mechanisms including DNA methylation are critically
involved in both host immune responses to viral infection and
subsequent diseases pathogenesis and severity (Gémez-Diaz et al.,
2012; Morales-Nebreda et al., 2019). In the context of SARS-CoV-2
infection, human studies suggest that DNA methylation states in
immune cells are altered during infection and associate with
COVID-19 disease severity (Bernardes et al., 2020; Balnis et al.,
2021; Castro de Moura et al., 2021; Corley et al. 2021). We
previously reported a unique candidate immune cell DNA
methylation signature associated with severe COVID-19 that was
distinct from influenza, primary HIV infection, and HIV/mild
COVID-19 coinfection (Corley et al. 2021). Additional studies
have extended these findings and reported distinct genome-wide
DNA methylation differences in peripheral blood from COVID-19
patients based on disease severity (Balnis et al., 2021; Castro de
Moura et al., 2021; Zhou et al., 2021). Insights into host DNA
methylation states and COVID-19 have mainly focused on severe
COVID-19 and are limited by the use of cross-sectional study
designs. Longitudinal epigenetic studies of COVID-19 are lacking,
and it remains unclear whether rapid changes to immune cell
epigenetic DNA methylation patterns occur in healthy individuals
that recover from non-hospitalized COVID-19.

The severity of COVID-19 strongly depends on age, and aging
biomarkers may help explain this relationship and predict who is at
the highest risk of severe COVID-19 (Kuo et al., 2020; Mueller et al.,
2020). Distinct DNA methylation patterns have been utilized to
derive epigenetic measures of biological aging termed “epigenetic
clocks” (Horvath, 2013). Numerous epigenetic clocks have been
generated that appear to capture distinct aspects of aging and
associate with different biological hallmarks of aging,
environmental exposures, traits, and disease patterns (Horvath
and Raj, 2018; Liu et al., 2020; Higgins-Chen et al., 2021a; Oblak
et al., 2021). Many of the differences between clocks stem from being
trained to predict different aging-related variables, such as
chronological age, mortality risk, or mitotic divisions. Moreover,
epigenetic clocks are accurate predictors of mortality risk (Lu et al.,
2019), biomarkers of pathogen exposure (Horvath and Levine, 2015;
Boulias et al., 2016; Corley et al., 2021), and correlates of lung function
and immune inflammation (Hillary et al. 2020, 2021). Evidence
suggest that severe COVID-19 disease may impact certain epigenetic
clocks (Mongelli et al., 2021; Corley et al., 2021) and biological aging
captured by PhenoAge may inform COVID-19 outcomes (Kuo et al.,
2020). More recent epigenetic clock studies have reported conflicting
evidence for biological age acceleration and telomere shortening in

COVID-19 survivors (Mongelli et al., 2021), with some finding no
clock acceleration in COVID-19 patients (Franzen et al. 2021).
Whether changes occur to epigenetic clocks in healthy individuals
that recover from non-hospitalized COVID-19 still remains unclear.
In addition, whether epigenetic clocks are impacted following mRNA
COVID-19 vaccination remains understudied.

In this study, we first examined whether alterations to DNA
methylation states, blood immune cell type composition, and
epigenetic clocks occurred in peripheral blood following COVID-
19 using a longitudinal study design of 21 healthy participants
prior to and following test-confirmed COVID-19. Next, we also
evaluated longitudinal DNA methylation states, blood immune
cell type composition, and epigenetic clocks of 36 healthy
participants prior to and following complete two-dose mRNA-
based COVID-19 vaccination.

Table 1 presents the baseline (pre-COVID-19) characteristics of
study participants prior to COVID-19 diagnosis. Participants were
healthy (n = 14M, 7F) and ranged in chronological age from 18 to
73 years (Median = 46 years). Genome-wide DNA methylation was
assayed from blood biospecimens of all participants at baseline and
post-COVID-19 using the Illumina MethylationEPIC platform
(Pidsley et al., 2016). Baseline DNA methylation for participants
was obtained at a median of 19 weeks prior to the first COVID-19
positive test (Range: 4-50 weeks). COVID-19 exposure and SARS-
CoV-2 infection of participants for the post-COVID-19 timepoint
was confirmed utilizing clinical PCR testing (n = 18) and serology
testing (n = 3). Post-COVID-19 DNA methylation was assessed at a
median time frame of 8.35 weeks after testing positive. The earliest
captured participant's post-COVID-19 DNA methylation was
within 1 week following COVID-19 diagnosis and ranged out to
a maximum of 6 months after diagnosis.

included genome-wide DNA methylation data generated from 21
participants prior to (pre-COVID-19) and following COVID-19
diagnosis (post-COVID-19) (Figure 1A). Our repeated measures
analysis of DNA methylation at pre- and post-COVID-19 time
points revealed 756 differentially methylated loci significant at
FDR (Benjamini-Hochberg) adjusted p < 0.05 that were not
significantly biased to a specific chromosomal location
(Figure 1B, Supplementary Dataset $1); 57.8% of the
COVID-19-related DML increased in DNA methylation states
(hypermethylation) post-COVID-19 compared to pre-timepoint
for participants. Next, we examined whether these COVID-19-
related DML in blood were enriched in specific genomic contexts
and found a significant enrichment in the gene body (Odds Ratio
= 1.2; p = 0.005) and the northern (Odds Ratio = 1.7; p = 0.0004)

and southern (Odds Ratio = 1.8; p = 0.0001) shelf regions located
adjacent to CpG island shore regions compared to the expected
distribution of methylation sites assayed across the human
genome (Figure 1C), suggestive of perturbations at regulatory
regions in the human genome likely linked to transcriptional
differences. We observed that the 756 COVID-19-associated
DML were related to 516 annotated protein coding genes

Since our assessments of DNA methylation in participants
occurred in whole blood, we next applied a bioinformatic tool to
identify the potential cellular source in blood of COVID-19
exposure-related differences in participants. We analyzed
whether there was an enrichment for overlap with potential
functional elements in our set of 756 DML related to COVID-
19 compared to matched background DML using the
experimentally derived Functional element Overlap analysis of
ReGions from the EWAS tool (eFORGE) (Breeze et al., 2019).
eFORGE uses 815 datasets from the ENCODE, Roadmap
Epigenomics, and BLUEPRINT epigenomic mapping projects
to detect enriched tissues, cell types, and genomic regions of DML
from DNA methylation profiling studies. Our analysis utilizing
the chromatin in all 15-state marks reference revealed the greatest
enrichment in actively transcribed genes of primary B cells
(q-value = 3.65e-10), mononuclear cells (q-value = 4.39e-8),
and neutrophils (q-value = 1.03e-11) from peripheral blood
suggesting potential cell composition and/or cell type-specific
effects of COVID-19 infection in blood (Supplementary Dataset
$2). In addition to these immune cell-type findings, we evaluated
whether the observed epigenetic signature mimic methylation
changes in SARS-CoV-2 target tissues. This analysis revealed
significant enrichment in multiple organ systems supporting
COVID-19 as a complex = multisystem _—_ disorder
(Supplementary Dataset $2). Notable enrichments were
observed in actively transcribed genes of the digestive system
(sigmoid colon, q-value = 8.42e-8; duodenum smooth muscle,
q-value = 5.06e-8; rectal mucosa, q-value = 3.19e-7; duodenum
mucosa, q-value = 3.19e-7), placenta (q-value = 6.21e-06), spleen
(q-value = 1.25e-05), brain (anterior caudate, q-value = 1.32e-05;
hippocampus, q-value = 2.13e-05), liver (q-value = 3.92e-05), and
lung (q-value = 9.22e-05) (Supplementary Dataset 2). These data
support the notion of COVID-19 impacting the epigenetic
landscape as a multisystem disorder involving both immune
cells and nonimmune cells in disease pathogenesis.

Among the top Af-value methylation changes comparing pre-
and post-COVID-19 time points, we observed two differentially
methylated loci (cg02037503 and cg23712970) in a gene promoter
transcription start site regulatory region of the apoptotic chromatin
condensation inducer 1 (ACIN1) gene Supplementary Figure $2
that decreased in DNA methylation following COVID-19 by
approximately 15% for both CpG sites (Figures 1D,E). This
gene codes a nuclear protein that induces apoptotic chromatin
condensation after activation by caspase-3 (Sahara et al., 1999),
which we previously reported was increased in red blood cells of
hospitalized COVID-19 participants (Plassmeyer et al., 2021). We
also observed differential methylation at cg10846936 related to the
caspase recruitment domain family member 14 (CARD14) gene
that is involved in activating nuclear factor kappa-B involved in
immune inflammation. Participants’ methylation levels at this
loci increased comparing pre- and post-COVID-19 time
points from a mean of 44.47-53.44% (Figure 1F). Using a
validation analysis of this loci in a public COVID-19 DNA
methylation dataset GSE168739 (Castro de Moura et al., 2021),
we observed that the mean methylation state of this loci in

lysregulated glycemia in COVID-19 (Reiterer et al.,

participants post-COVID-19 timepoint (mean DNAm = 53.5%)
was more similar (p = 0.15, Tukey’s test) than participants pre-
COVID-19 levels (mean DNAm = 44.6%) (p = 0.0001, Tukey’s
test) compared to the levels of this loci in a public blood DNA
methylation dataset available from 407 confirmed COVID-19
participants (mean DNAm = 56.5%) (Castro de Moura et al.,
2021) and is shown in Supplementary Figure $3. Additional top

DNA Methylation-Based Estimates of
Cell-Type Fractions in Blood Are
Significantly Changed Following COVID-19

Infection

DNA methylation data can be utilized to infer fractions of
immune cell types present in a heterogenous blood sample
based on a reference list of CpGs identified from differentially
methylated cell-types (Houseman et al., 2012). Hence, we used a
paired f-test analysis and examined whether participants DNAm-
based estimates of CD8* T cells, CD4* T cells, natural killer (NK)
cells, B cells, monocytes, granulocytes, plasmablasts, exhausted
T cells (CD8*CD28-CD45RA-), CD8 naive T cells, and CD4
naive T cells significantly differed comparing pre- and post-
COVID-19 time points. Since the human immune system
undergoes dramatic aging-related changes, we stratified our
analysis into two groups based on those under or over
50 years of age. We observed no significant differences in the
inferred proportion of CD8* T cells following COVID-19 for
those under and over 50 years of age (Figure 2A). Participants
under 50 years of age showed significant increases in the
percentage of CD4* T cells in blood following COVID-19
(Figure 2B). In contrast, in those over 50 years of age, we
observed a significant decrease in the percentage of CD4*
T cells in blood following COVID-19 (Figure 2B), reflecting
COVID-19 reports of lymphopenia. In addition, we observe
significant decreases in the percentage of B cells in those over
50 years of age (Figure 2D). In contrast, we observed shifts in
decreasing plasmablasts percentage (Figure 2G), and increasing
CD4* naive T cells were observed in those under 50 years of age
following COVID-19 (Figure 2J). Innate immune NK an
monocytes cell proportions did not significantly change
following COVID-19 (Figures 2C,E). We also did not observe
significant differences in granulocytes, exhausted CD8* T cells,
and CD8* naive T cells (Figures 2F,H,I). Together, these findings
suggest age-related COVID-19 shifts in specific immune cell
types occur in healthy individuals.
We utilized the inferred cell type proportional changes
following COVID-19 to examine relationships with age an
the DNA methylation change pre- vs. post-COVID-19 for 10
of the top differentially methylated loci we had identified. This

correlative analysis showed that chronological age was
significantly associated with the percent change in DNA
methylation for 9/10 DML, suggesting the signal of change for
those DNA methylation sites related to age and potential
plasticity loss (Figure 3). Moreover, chronological age was
significantly associated with the inferred cell type proportional
changes following COVID-19 for CD4* T cells, plasmablasts, and
CD4* naive T cells adding further support to our observed age-
related COVID-19 shifts in specific immune cell type
observations (Figure 3). Notably, we observed that shifts in
inferred immune cell type proportional following COVID-19
ignificantly related to the extent of DNA methylation level
changes for 10 the DML we examined, suggesting the
COVID-19 DNA methylation signature to be substantially
influenced by cell-type shifts (Figure 3).

DNA Methylation Changes in Blood
Following COVID-19 Overlap With
COVID-19-Related Transcriptional Gene
Sets

Various studies have identified transcriptional changes from
SARS-CoV-2 infection (Blanco-Melo et al., 2020; Wilk et al.,
2020). Since aberrant DNA methylation is commonly linked to

transcriptional alterations, we sought to test whether the 516
genes containing a differentially methylated loci we identified
through DNA methylation profiling of pre- and post-COVID-19
infection overlapped with COVID-19-related genes
transcriptionally altered during SARS-CoV-2 infection utilizing
the Enrichr COVID-19 gene set online tool (
2016). This analysis revealed significant overlap with genes that
are differentially expressed in SARS-CoV-2 animal models
(rhesus macaques blood, p = 0.017; mouse heart, p = 0.018;
mouse spleen, p = 0.027; and hamster blood, p = 0.027), COVID-
19 human biospecimens (late stage infection blood, p = 0.027;
human cornea, p = 0.032), and in vitro infection models (Calu-3,
p = 0.030) (Table 2). These findings suggest the DNA methylation
patterns associated with COVID-19 likely play a role in
transcriptional activation or repression of conserved host
transcriptional responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection involving
specific gene networks.

Previous studies including our work reported epigenetic age

sought to investigate in this pre- and post-COVID-19 cohort of

non-hospitalized COVID-19 and relatively healthy individuals
whether COVID-19 exposure impacted epigenetic clock
estimates. We calculated epigenetic estimates for Horvath’s
multi-tissue predictor DNAmAge based on 353 CpG sites
(Horvath, 2013), the Horvath skin and blood clock based on
391 CpG sites (Horvath et al., 2018), Levine DNAmPhenoAge
based on 513 CpG sites (Levine et al., 2018), Hannum’s clock
based on 71 CpG sites (Hannum et al., 2013), the Lu telomere
length predictor, and DNA methylation-based mortality risk
assessment [GrimAge (Lu et al., 2019)] using the Horvath
online calculator. However, we found large bidirectional
fluctuations in epigenetic age up to 8.99 years for DNAmAge,
4.49 years for Horvath skin and blood, 7.94 years for
DNAmPhenodge, 6.25 years for Hannum’s clock, and
4.03 years for GrimAge that did not seem to be related to
COVID-19 infection Supplementary Figure $4. Instead, this
appeared to be attributable to widespread technical noise in
DNAm measurement (Bose et al., 2014; Logue et al., 2017;
Sugden et al., 2020), as previous studies have found that
repeated measurements of the same sample to deviate up to
9 years (Higgins-Chen et al., 2021b). To mitigate the impacts of

these unreliable epigenetic clock estimates, we applied a novel
principal component version of epigenetic clocks that permits a
more reliable estimate for longitudinal studies (Higgins-Chen
et al, 2021b). Next, we applied the principal-component
epigenetic clocks algorithm based on 78,464 CpGs to the
dataset to obtain PC-based epigenetic clock estimates and PC-
based residuals after regressing PC-age predicted by the
algorithm over chronological age for participants prior to and
following COVID-19. Since age is a well-known risk factor for
COVID-19 severity and our sample set contained participants
that ranged in chronological age from 18 to 73 years, we stratified
our longitudinal analysis of epigenetic clocks into two groups,
people under 50 and people over 50 years of age. Application of
our novel principal component-based computational solution to
optimize the aging signal from epigenetic clocks and minimize
noise revealed no significant differences in epigenetic age based
on the PCHorvath1, PCHorvath2, and PCHannum epigenetic
clocks for both groups following COVID-19 (Figures 4A-C). In
addition, PCDNAmTL was not significantly altered following
COVID-19 (Figure 4D). We observed that the PCPhenoAge
clock was significantly increased in those over 50 years of age

n contrast to the observations for those over 50 years of age,
PCPhenoAge was significantly decreased in those under 50 years

compositional changes. Indeed, we observed that the increase in

COVID-19 was significantly related to the magnitude of
changes in the percent of CD4 T cells, B cells, granulocytes,
plasmablasts, exhausted T cells, CD8 naive T cells, and CD4 naive
T cells (Figure 5). We did not observe significant relationships
between the increase in PCPhenoAge and CD8T cells, NK cells,

extent of increase in PCGrimAge estimates for participants
following COVID-19 was significantly related to blood
immune cell compositional changes in CD4 T cells, NK cells,
B cells, granulocytes, and plasmablasts (Figure 5). The loss in
percent CD4* T cells following COVID-19 for all participants
significantly related to older chronological age and increasing
epigenetic age inferred from all epigenetic clocks (PCHorvath1,
PCHorvath2, PCHannum, PCPhenoAge, and PCGrimAge)
(Figure 5), supporting observations of lymphopenia related to
COVID-19. Together, these findings suggest that the epigenetic
aging signal related to COVID-19 exposure is driven by changes
in blood immune cell type composition. We also examined

mRNA COVID-19 Vaccination in Older
Individuals Decreases Epigenetic Age and
May Reflect Age-Related B Cell and

Plasmablasts Induction and Expansion

To complement our pre- and post-COVID-19 exposure dataset,
we sought to examine the impact of mRNA COVID-19
vaccination upon epigenetic clocks by obtaining DNA
methylation profiles from blood of participants prior to and
following mRNA COVID-19 vaccination. We examined 36
individuals (n = 21 females; n = 15 males) ranging in age
from 22 to 69 years old that received either the Moderna (n =
13) or Pfizer (n = 23) mRNA vaccine. The median time since the
second mRNA vaccine dose received by participants and DNA
methylation data obtained for the post-vaccination timepoint was
57.9 days. We calculated principal-component epigenetic clock
estimates and observed that PCHorvath] and PCHorvath2
epigenetic age estimates were significantly decreased following
complete mRNA vaccination comparing pre- and _post-
vaccination time points for all 36 participants by an average of
1.03-1.58 years (Figures 6A,B). Exploratory analyses stratified by

received Moderna mRNA vaccination significantly reduced
epigenetic age estimates based on PCHorvath1 by an average
of 2.75 years and PCHorvath2 by an average of 3.91 years
following complete vaccination (Figures 7A,B). In contrast, we
observed no significant differences in epigenetic age estimates for
people less than 50 that received Moderna and for both those less
than and over 50 years of age that received Pfizer (Figures
7A,B,G,H). Whether these stratified results relate to Moderna
vaccine containing a higher dose (100 ug) compared to Pfizer
(30 ug) will need further examination. There was no significant
difference in time from last dose, and when DNA methylation
data were obtained post-vaccination between vaccine brands
(Supplementary Figure S6), suggesting time was not a
confounding factor for vaccine differences in epigenetic age
reduction in those over 50 years of age. In correlative analyses
for all participants receiving an mRNA vaccine, we observed the
extent of decreasing epigenetic age based on the PCHorvath1 and
PCHorvath2 clocks and increasing PCDNAmTL significantly
related to increasing chronological age (Figures 7M,N,Q). We
did not observe any significant differences from mRNA
vaccination upon PCHannum, PCPhenoAge, and PCDNAmTL
(Figures 7C-E,I-K), and delta epigenetic age changes for
PCHannum, PCPhenoAge, and PCGrimAge were not
significantly related to chronological age (Figures 70,P,R).
Next, we examined whether the decrease in PCHorvath1 and
PCHorvath2 following mRNA vaccination related to immune cell
type compositional changes and/or DNA methylation inferred

We tested whether artificial short-term in vitro exposure to
SARS-CoV-2 virus (0.1 MOI) impacted PC-based epigenetic
clocks in human peripheral mononuclear cells. We exposed
viable PBMC’s from two uninfected donors (Donor 1, under

50 years of age; Donor 2: over 50 years of age) to a passage 4 stock
of SARS-CoV-2 (0.1 MOI) in vitro for 60 h and compared DNA
methylation levels to mock uninfected. We did not observe the
evidence of SARS-CoV-2 replication in PBMCs after 60h as
assessed by nucleocapsid flow cytometry assessments. PC-based
epigenetic estimates of difference in epigenetic age comparing
mock and SARS-CoV-2 exposed PBMC revealed changes less
than lyear for PCHorvathl, PCHorvath2, and PCHannum
clocks (Supplementary Figure $7). Notably, we observed
divergent donor-dependent impacts from addition of
monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA) stimulation, a TLR4 agonist,
for 1-60 h SARS-CoV-2 exposed PBMC’s for all PC-based clocks
(Supplementary Figure $7). As a comparator dataset, we
generated DNA methylation data from mock and SARS-CoV-
2 infected Calu-3 cells for 96h and observed epigenetic age did
not increase for PC-based epigenetic clock comparing mock and
infected cells.

DISCUSSION

In this pilot study, we examined whether SARS-CoV-2 infection
and mRNA COVID-19 vaccination impacted DNA methylation
states and epigenetic clocks in healthy individuals in the short

term. Our findings revealed that significant differences in DNA
methylation in blood associate with SARS-CoV-2 infection at 756
CpG sites, suggesting an immune cell-based epigenetic signature
of COVID-19 may derive from aberrant DNA methylation states
related to immune dysfunction induced by COVID-19. These
findings support epigenetic findings from other groups that have
reported distinct DNA methylation states in blood as a potential
biomarker of COVID-19 (Balnis et al., 2021; Castro de Moura
et al., 2021; Zhou et al., 2021). Moreover, our epigenetic clock
findings reveal an age-related impact of epigenetic age increase
associated with natural SARS-CoV-2 infection on the
PCPhenoAge epigenetic clock and mortality risk estimate
PCGrimAge in mild/moderate cases. Whether the extent and
durability of this perturbation to these two epigenetic clock
estimates is related to long COVID-19 or long-term aging
outcomes remain an intriguing area for further investigation.
In contrast to natural SARS-CoV-2 infection, we observed that
two epigenetic clocks +==(DNAmAge/PCHorvathl and
DNAmAgeSkinBlood/PCHorvath2) were decreased following
mRNA COVID-19 vaccination in individuals over 50. The
extent of decreased epigenetic age following mRNA-COVID-
19 vaccination significantly related to changes in B cells and
plasmablasts, highlighting the potential utility of epigenetic clocks
in capturing vaccine responses and tracking the need for booster
shots due to waning COVID-19 immunity in older individuals.
These results are more robust because multiple clocks that
putatively measure the same aging phenotype
(ie, PCGrimAge and PCPhenoAge predict mortality risk,
while PCHorvath] and PCHorvath2 track with chronological
age) show similar relationships to COVID-19. Together, this pilot
longitudinal epigenetic dataset of natural COVID-19 exposure

and mRNA COVID-19 vaccination have important implications
for research into the impact of COVID-19 on aging and the
potential for mRNA vaccination to impact epigenetic aging in the
immune system. Future research will need to examine whether
COVID-19 and mRNA vaccine-related changes to epigenetic age
are biologically meaningful. It is important to note that although
epigenetic age robustly predicts age-related morbidity and
mortality in cross-sectional studies (Horvath and Raj, 2018;
Oblak et al., 2021), it is unknown if modifying epigenetic age
in the short term leads to changes in long-term outcomes.
Prior research has shown that the host epigenetic landscape is
altered during coronavirus infection (Schafer and Baric, 2017).
Evidence indicate that SARS-CoV-2 infection has a substantial
impact upon the host immune cell epigenetic and transcriptional
landscape in severe COVID-19 (Corley et al., 2021; Rendeiro
et al., 2021). Our findings support a recent cross-sectional human
DNA methylation study of COVID-19 that reported DNA
methylation patterns of COVID-19 convalescents compared to
uninfected controls (Huoman et al., 2021). In addition, our study
provides the first examination of longitudinal DNA methylation
changes in the blood of healthy participants prior to and
following test-confirmed mild/moderate COVID-19. We
observed blood-based DNA methylation changes associated
with COVID-19 exposure in healthy participants ranging in
age with 756 differentially methylated CpGs identified. Among
the COVID-19 differentially methylated loci detected in blood,
we observed hypermethylation related to the caspase recruitment
domain family member 14 (CARD14) gene. This gene encodes a
protein that has been shown to interact with BCL10 that
functions as a positive regulator of cell apoptosis and NF-
kappa-B activation (Bertin et al., 2001). Moreover, CARD14
may play a role in protecting cells against apoptosis. We
observed that the percent change in DNA methylation inferred
immune cell type proportion for CD8 T cells for participants
following COVID-19 exposure significantly associated with the
DNA methylation percent change related to CARD14. This
suggests that a subset of DNA methylation changes related to
COVID-19 exposure were due to cell type compositional changes.
Notably, we also observed the differentially methylated CpGs
associated with COVID-19 were enriched in transcriptional gene
sets identified from published SARS-CoV-2 human, animal
model, and in vitro infection studies (Kuleshov et al., 2016,
2020). These findings suggest that DNA methylation changes
associated with COVID-19 likely participate in the regulation and
modulation of host gene expression from infection. Together, this
first set of findings support the notion that distinct host DNA
methylation states in circulating immune cells serves as a
COVID-19 specific epigenetic signature. The durability of this
COVID-19 epigenetic signature remains a key question for
future study.

Recent work utilizing a cross-sectional study design reported
that epigenetic clocks are not altered in COVID-19 (Franzen
et al., 2021). Our work contrasts with this report and suggests that
specific epigenetic clocks may be altered by COVID-19 based on
age. We utilized a more powerful longitudinal study design of
individuals prior to and following test-confirmed COVID-19 and
applied a novel principal component-based assessment of

epigenetic clocks that mitigates issues with reliability in standard
epigenetic clock algorithms. We observed a divergence in the
epigenetic clock estimate PCPhenoAge and epigenetic clock
mortality algorithm PCGrimAge based on age in individuals
following COVID-19. Slight epigenetic age acceleration in the
short term appeared in those individuals over 50 years of age that
were infected with SARS-CoV-2. In contrast, epigenetic age
appeared to reduce in those individuals less than 50 years of
age following COVID-19. PCPhenoAge and PCGrimAge are
among the strongest epigenetic predictors of mortality risk
(Levine et al., 2018; Lu et al., 2019; Higgins-Chen et al.,
2021a). These findings support the critical role of age as a
COVID-19 risk factor and suggest that specific epigenetic
clocks can capture an age-dependent perturbation to
epigenetic clocks following COVID-19. Moreover, prior multi-
omic analysis has shown that the Levine clock accelerates with
cellular senescence and mitochondrial dysfunction (Liu et al.,
2020). Prior studies of epigenetic clocks in COVID-19 utilized
different sets of clocks, which may explain their conflicting results
(Mongelli et al., 2021; Corley et al., 2021; Franzen et al., 2021).
Interrogating a wide array of clocks simultaneously is essential for
determining which clocks are most related to COVID-19 or
vaccination. Furthermore, findings are more robust if multiple

clocks predicting the same phenotype show the same relationship
to COVID-19.

A plausible interpretation of PCPhenoAge/PCGrimAge
results after infection is an age-related signal of both
immunosenescence and inflammaging. Once the immune
system is activated in younger individuals by SARS-CoV-2
infection, they look younger by the epigenetic clock due to a
robust activation of the immune response that reflects in younger
individuals (not that they are actually becoming younger). In
older individuals, activation of non-specific inflammatory
pathways after SARS-CoV-2 infection appears to increase the
epigenetic age because of the activation of pathways that overlap
are similar to inflammaging. An alternative interpretation for
divergence in epigenetic age based on age during SARS-CoV-2
infection might involve the biological process of hormesis:
moderate stressors can improve health by causing a
compensatory response (Epel, 2020). COVID-19 might serve
as a hormetic stress in non-hospitalized younger individuals,
while it serves as a toxic stressor in older adults or any severe case.

Aging drives immunosenescence with implications for a
decline in adaptive immunity resulting in reduced vaccine
responses and vaccine durability in older adults. The age-
related decline in immune function including reduced thymic

output of naive T cells and dampened B cell generation has
notably led to decreased vaccine efficacy in older individuals
(Soiza et al., 2021). Indeed, building evidence for COVID-19
indicate a declined humoral and cellular immune response in
older individuals (Collier et al., 2021; Levin et al., 2021). Yet,
failure to achieve a protected or durable response after
vaccination is poorly understood despite occurring commonly
among many elderly individuals. Our epigenetic clock data
following mRNA COVID-19 vaccination revealed an age-
related decrease in epigenetic age following vaccination. Our
findings also revealed that the change in epigenetic age
following vaccination was specifically related to immune cell
type compositional changes in the percentage of B cells,
plasmablasts, and granulocytes. These findings support work
showing that SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines induce persistent
germinal center B cell response that enables robust humoral
immunity (Turner et al., 2021). Our findings do not provide
any insights into the particular impact of the mRNA lipid
nanoparticle compared to the expressed spike protein upon
different epigenetic clocks. These compelling findings suggest
that epigenetic profiles and specifically epigenetic clock estimates
may provide insights into individual and age-related humoral
immune responses to COVID-19 vaccination. Previous work has
shown the impact of influenza vaccination on persistent

epigenomic remodeling of immune cells (Wimmers et al.,
2021) and explored the idea of whether epigenetic age could
relate to vaccine responses in the context of influenza (Gensous
et al., 2018).

Recent work examining T cell exhaustion after recovery from
chronic infection in humans has found that epigenetic scars of
CD8* T cell exhaustion persists in humans (Yates et al., 2021),
suggesting indelible imprints on the host immune cell epigenome
from viral infection. The hypothesis of a persistent epigenetic
dysregulation of host immune cells contributing to long COVID-
19 remains unclear. Whether durable changes to epigenetic clocks
are reflected by epigenetic scars of particular immune cell types
and relate to long COVID-19 is a compelling hypothesis to
pursue.

Our findings highlight the benefits of our computational
solution using principal components for calculating PC-based
epigenetic clocks for longitudinal studies (Higgins-Chen et al.,
2021b). Using standard epigenetic clock estimates, we observed
variation up to 9 years in participants pre- and post-timepoint
samples epigenetic age estimates for all clocks that lead to non-
significant results. While the application of PC-based epigenetic
clocks pulled out a biological signal suggesting that mild/
moderate COVID-19 from SARS-CoV-2 infection and mRNA
vaccination impacted epigenetic clocks, the biological

mechanisms that influence detrimental or beneficial changes in
epigenetic clocks remains unclear. Ongoing research is
deconstructing dissimilar epigenetic clocks and may provide
further insights into the precise biological mechanisms
captured from age-related alterations in the methylation
andscape during infection and mRNA vaccination.
The developed mRNA vaccines for COVID-19 have been
shown to elicit a potent humoral immune response and be
highly efficacious at preventing COVID-19 and severe disease
outcomes (Polack et al., 2020; Baden et al., 2021; Tartof et al.,
2021). Our DNA methylation dataset was obtained at a median
post second dose of around 2 months. Based on data showing
durability of vaccine responses out to 6 months post-vaccination
(Doria-Rose et al., 2021), our DNA methylation data were
captured during an effective post-vaccine time frame window.
Future studies will need to harness serial sample collection of
participants during the course of mRNA vaccination and assess
critical time points for the impacts of mRNA vaccination upon
epigenetic clocks. Moreover, our observations of age-related
impacts from mRNA vaccination upon epigenetic age warrants
further investigation to determine whether this measure may be
relevant to age-related waning vaccine effectiveness. Last,
epigenetic age assessments of participants who received
heterologous prime-boost vaccination against COVID-19
(Borobia et al., 2021; Nordstrém et al., 2021; Pozzetto et al.,
2021; Schmidt et al., 2021; Shaw et al., 2021) and heterologous
booster vaccinations (Atmar et al., 2021) should be studied.
Considering the challenges with longitudinal blood collection
and acquisition of epigenetic DNA methylation data from
participants at time points prior to and following  test-
confirmed COVID-19, all of the published COVID-19 DNA
methylation studies have been cross-sectional study designs
(Bernardes et al., 2020; Balnis et al., 2021; Castro de Moura
et al., 2021; Corley et al., 2021). Longitudinal epigenetic studies
are considered the gold standard study design to mitigate
interindividual variation in DNA methylation patterns and
track environmental and pathogen-induced changes to the
epigenome (Chen et al., 2018). Hence, our assessment of
longitudinal DNA methylation of 21 participants provides a
discovery dataset for examining the short-term impacts of
COVID-19 upon the host immune cell epigenome and impact
on epigenetic clock estimates. Our longitudinal COVID-19 DNA
methylation dataset consisted of healthy participants that ranged
across the lifespan from 18 to 73 years of age. Moreover, the
collection of DNA methylation data following test-confirmed
COVID-19 exposure occurred within a short-term time frame of
a 6-months window and occurred early during the COVID-19
pandemic reflecting infection with a less evolved, less contagious,
and potentially less severe SARS-CoV-2 virus than recent variants
such as the Delta variant. Hence, our findings are limited by these
potential factors. These longitudinal findings need to be
confirmed in a larger sample size, across diverse regions and
genotypes, among individuals across the lifespan, in people
infected with emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, and across
COVID-19 severities including those individuals who recover
and suffer from long-lasting symptoms termed post-COVID.

et

Despite the strengths of this longitudinal epigenetic study,
there are several limitations. First, our longitudinal study design
only included two time points to examine changes related to
COVID-19 and mRNA vaccination comparing baseline and a
short-term follow-up assessment of DNA methylation. Future
studies will need to study a larger sample size and determine
whether these age-related divergent changes to epigenetic clocks
are durable following COVID-19 and potentially relate to those
with long COVID-19 syndrome. In addition, there was variation
in the time following confirmed COVID-19 or mRNA COVID-
19 vaccination for when the post sample assay for DNA
methylation was completed. Yet, given the complete lack of
longitudinal DNA methylation studies of COVID-19 and
mRNA COVID-19 vaccination, we provide discovery findings
that are compelling regarding specific DNA methylation changes
and epigenetic clocks that warrant further investigation. Future
studies that have serial blood collection of participants
throughout the course of mRNA vaccination and even
following booster shots will be extremely valuable for
epigenetic clock investigations. Recent _ technological
advancements based on tagmentation-based indexing of
methylation sequencing (TIME-Seq) have scaled and reduced
the cost of epigenetic age predictions permitting methodology for
a more comprehensive study follow-up to our findings (Griffin
et al., 2021). We also acknowledge the limited clinical data for
participants and that the SARS-CoV-2 infection DNA
methylation dataset may be relevant to an early genetic lineage
neither reflecting emerging variants being monitored nor variants
of concern such as Delta (B.1.617.2).

METHODS

The Study Cohort

Deidentified DNA methylation data were generated by
TruDiagnostic as part of a retrospective non-randomized study
to assess the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection and mRNA
vaccination upon DNA methylation patterns. Participant’s
post-COVID-19 sample DNA methylation was test confirmed
by PCR testing or serology testing and occurred between August
2020 and March 2021. This study was approved by the IRCM IRB
and WCM IRB.

DNA Methylation Assessment

Peripheral whole blood was collected by the lancet and capillary
method into lysis buffer and DNA extract, and 500 ng of DNA
of bisulfite converted using the EZ DNA Methylation kit (Zymo
Research) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Bisulfite-converted DNA samples were randomly assigned to
a chip well on the Infinitum HumanMethylationEPIC BeadChip,
amplified, hybridized onto the array, stained, washed, and
imaged with the Illumina iScan SQ instrument to obtain raw
image intensities. DNA methylation data for longitudinal
sampling of participant’s pre- and post-COVID-19 and pre-
and post-vaccination time points were assayed for each
participant at separate times.

DNA Methylation Analyses
Raw MethylationEPIC array IDAT intensity data were loaded

and preprocessed in the R statistical programming language
(http://www.r-project.org) using the Chip Analysis
Methylation Pipeline (ChAMP, version 2.8.3) (Tian et al.,
2017). IDAT files were loaded using the champ.load function.
All samples passed quality control metrics. Comprehensive
filtering was applied to the dataset for probes with detection
p-values <0.01, all non-CpG probes, previously published SNP-
related probes, multi-hit probes, and probes on sex
chromosomes. Methylation beta values ranging from 0-1
(corresponding to unmethylated to methylated signal
intensity) for each sample were normalized using the BMIQ
function implemented in the ChAMP pipeline. DNA
methylation epigenetic age parameters were calculated using
the Horvath’s web-based DNAmage calculator tool (Horvath,
2013; Lu et al., 2019). Cell type deconvolution estimates for blood
were calculated using EpiDISH package (Zheng et al., 2019). To
identify differentially methylated loci, we utilized an FDR
adjustment (Benjamini-Hochberg) and adjusted the p-value
cutoff at 0.05 to compare participant’s pre-COVID-19
methylation data to post-COVID-19 methylation data. Genes
related to differentially methylated loci were utilized for a
COVID-19 gene set analyses from the Enrichr web tool
(Kuleshov et al., 2016).

Epigenetic Clock Analysis and Estimating

Blood Immune Cell Type Composition
Epigenetic clock estimates, DNA methylation-based cell type
deconvolution proportions, and epigenetic biomarkers were
calculated using the online calculator (https://dnamage.
genetics.ucla.new). Principal component-based epigenetic clock
estimates were calculated utilizing an R script and 78,464 CpGs
for each sample in a beta matrix. Mean imputation was utilized
for missing values. Pace of aging was calculated utilizing the
DunedinPACE algorithm (DunedinPoAm_45). To calculate pace
of aging, noob normalized, and masked beta values were first
processed from raw IDAT files using SeSAMe R package (Zhou
et al., 2018). To limit the number of batch effects caused by
processing multiple bead chips, individual bead chips were
processed at a time to generate the normalized beta values and
then used to quantify pace of aging. The pace of aging metric was
then calculated using the DunedinPACE algorithm described in
elsky et al. (2021). Briefly, the algorithm uses 19 different
physiological biomarkers to generate overall pace of aging
from the Dunedin Study cohort (N = 1037). A standardized
average rate of aging is then regressed using an elastic net
regression model against methylation values generated from
blood collected from the cohort at the age of 45, which
identified 173 CpG sites that are associated with the pace of
aging metric. The DunedinPACE algorithm was used to calculate
the pace of aging measure obtained from authors. Analyses were
performed in R 4.1.1 and RStudio Version 1.4.1717. Figures were
made using GraphPad and corrplot R package.

Deidentified donor PBMC specimens were obtained from
Astarte Biological for in vitro exposure to 0.1 MOI SARS-
CoV-2 for 60h. Calu-3 cells were infected for 96h.

Abstract

Background. Up to 30% of people infected with SARS-CoV-2 report disabling symptoms
2 years after the infection. Over 100 persistent symptoms have been associated with Post-Acute
COVID-19 Symptoms (PACS) and/or long-COVID, showing a significant clinical heterogeneity.
To develop effective, patient-targeted treatment, a better understanding of underlying
mechanisms is needed. Epigenetics has helped elucidating the pathophysiology of several
ealth conditions and it might help unravelling inter-individual differences in patients with
PACS and long-COVID. As accumulating research is exploring epigenetic mechanisms in
PACS and long-COVID, we systematically summarized the available literature on the topic.
Methods. We interrogated five databases (Medline, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus and
medXriv/bioXriv) and followed PRISMA and SWiM guidelines to report our results.
Results. Eight studies were included in our review. Six studies explored DNA methylation in
PACS and/or long-COVID, while two studies explored miRNA expression in long-COVID
associated with lung complications. Sample sizes were mostly small and study quality was
low or fair. The main limitation of the included studies was a poor characterization of the
patient population that made a homogeneous synthesis of the literature challenging.
However, studies on DNA methylation showed that mechanisms related to the immune
and the autonomic nervous system, and cell metabolism might be implicated in the patho-
physiology of PACS and long-COVID.
Conclusion. Epigenetic changes might help elucidating PACS and long-COVID underlying
mechanisms, aid subgrouping, and point towards tailored treatments. Preliminary evidence
is promising but scarce. Biological and epigenetic research on long-COVID will benefit mil-
lions of people suffering from long-COVID and has the potential to be transferable and bene-
fit other conditions as well, such as Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome
(ME/CES). We urge future research to employ longitudinal designs and provide a better char-
acterization of included patients.

Introduction

COVID-19 is caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
(Ref. 1). Most individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 suffer from a mild disease but some
patients develop moderate-to-severe disease and require hospitalization (Refs 2, 3). Though
the majority of cases recover within the first 2-3 weeks, accumulating clinical observations
show that a significant proportion of patients with COVID-19 develop persistent symptoms
(Refs 2, 3, 4). Up to 30% of people infected with SARS-CoV-2 during the first wave reported
disabling symptoms, affecting everyday activities, 2 years after the infection (Ref. 4). Over 100
persistent symptoms have been associated with COVID-19, which led to coining the term
post-acute COVID-19 symptoms (PACS) and long-COVID. PACS refers to symptoms persist-
ing over 4 weeks after infection, while long-COVID is used when symptoms persist for 12
weeks or longer, and cannot be explained by alternative diagnosis (Ref. 5). The most common
symptoms are fatigue, post-exertional symptom exacerbation (PESE), pain, and cognitive pro-
blems - e.g. concentration difficulties and brain fog (Refs 6, 7). Long-COVID represents a
huge burden for these patients and a significant cost for healthcare systems worldwide
(Refs 8, 9, 10).

One crucial advancement to the understanding of long-COVID is the observation that dif-
ferent subgroups likely exist. Subgroups are probably not linked to the characteristics of the
virus or its variants, but rather to individual characteristics. While some factors such as obes-
ity, depression and the presence of comorbidities are risk factors for both acute COVID-19 and
long-COVID (Refs 11, 12, 13, 14) others are specific to either the acute or chronic phase.

Severity and mortality in acute COVID-19 was associated with
older age and male sex (Ref. 11). On the contrary, risk factors
for long-COVID include female sex and younger age, suggesting
that gender differences can be very relevant (Refs 12, 13, 14).
Importantly, long-COVID can develop after very mild symptoms
at onset (Ref. 15). A study on 545 patients found that over 70% of
people with persistent symptoms started with mild or moderate
initial infection (Ref. 16). This suggests that mechanisms of
long-COVID might be different from the ones in the acute
phase. Findings from research on COVID-19 should not be auto-
matically generalized to long-COVID, and specific research is
needed.

DNA methylation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from
severe COVID-19 patients showed hypermethylation o!
interferon-related genes and hypomethylation of cytokine genes,
suggesting a potential role for sustained inflammation (Ref. 21).
Other epigenome-wide DNA methylation association studies o!
peripheral blood samples of COVID-19 patients revealed an asso-
ciation between the increased severity of COVID-19 and altere
DNA methylation at genes involved in inflammasome-relate
pathways, major histocompatibility factor, and HLA-C involve
in the interferon-response pathway (Ref. 22). Similarly, non-
coding RNA interference exerted by long non-coding RNAs
(IncRNAs) or micro RNAs (miRNAs) (another set of mechanisms
responsible for post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression)
also show changes during COVID-19 infection (Refs 23, 24).
Hundreds of IncRNAs and miRNAs show significant differentia
expression which in turn predict severity of the infection and/or
mortality (Refs 25, 26, 27). Regulation of miRNAs and IncRNAs
seem to help to relieve acute symptoms via downregulation o!
pro-inflammatory cytokines (Refs 28, 29). Taken together, the
aforementioned observations show clear changes in epigenetic
signatures of patients with acute COVID-19.

These findings suggest that epigenetic biomarkers might help
unravelling inter-individual differences, disease presentation an
prognosis in patients with PACS and long-COVID. Research on
epigenetic changes and non-coding RNA interference is scarce
in long-COVID, but preliminary observations are accumulating.
These observations suggest that long-COVID can be explaine
by an intricate set of epigenetic mechanisms. For all these reasons,
a systematic summary of the current evidence is warranted, but is
currently unavailable and represents an important knowledge gap.
Here we report a systematic review aiming to summarize the avail-
able literature exploring epigenetic changes associated with PACS
or long-COVID.

The search strings for all five databases and the number of
results obtained can be found in the supplementary materia
(see Table $1 in Supplementary Material). The searches on
Medline and Embase were limited to human studies only. No
such limit was applied for searches on Web of Science an
Scopus. The same keywords were combined and entered in pre-
print platform such as medXriv and bioXriv. No publication
date and language restrictions were used. We only included arti-
cles published in English, Italian and Spanish. Cohort studies,
case-controls studies and cross-sectional studies were included.
Studies were not selected if they did not include a control
group. Only human studies assessing epigenetic biomarkers
such as chromatin accessibility, histone modifications, DNA
methylation, and miRNA and IncRNA expression in patients
with PACS or long-COVID were included. PACS included
patients experiencing symptoms persisting more than three
weeks from onset; long-COVID included patients experiencing
symptoms for at least 12 weeks from onset. Studies assessing epi-
genetic biomarkers only in acute COVID-19 patients were
excluded. In-vitro observations and preclinical studies were also
excluded.

Study selection

After removing the duplicates, the initial screening of studies was
done based on titles and abstracts by two reviewers independently
(MP and ER). This was done using the Rayyan platform. Any dis-
agreement between the two was resolved by a third reviewer (AP).
Afterwards, the full text of the relevant studies was checked
for eligibility by the two reviewers independently (MP and ER).
In case some of the studies did not report potentially relevant
information (e.g. a precise characterization of clinical symptoms
reported by patients), we tried to contact the corresponding
authors and asked for additional information.

Data extraction

Studies meeting inclusion criteria were divided between the two
reviewers (MP and ER) for independent data extraction, after
which both authors checked the extracted data of all the studies
and any discrepancies were resolved through discussion. The fol-
lowing data were extracted: first author’s name along with the year
of publication, study design, assessed epigenetic biomarkers,
blood fraction assessed (cells, serum or plasma), type of partici-
pants population (PACS or long-COVID), sample characteristics
(patients and controls characteristics, sample size, hospitalization
status), findings pertaining to the epigenetics of patients and the
quality of the study. The following epigenetic outcomes were

considered: chromatin accessibility, DNA methylation, miRNA
and IncRNA profiling, and histone modifications. For each out-
come, studies enrolling patients with either Post-Acute
COVID-19 or long-COVID were grouped together.

Quality assessment

The quality assessment for all the studies was done independently
by the two authors (MP and ER) and disagreements were resolved
through discussion. Methodological quality was assessed using
the NIH study quality assessment tools (https://www.nhlbi.nih.
gov/health-topics/study-quality-assessment-tools). We included
three additional questions to the ones present in the tool, to
include questions regarding confounding variables particularly
important for the study of epigenetic biomarkers in the target
population and a few other questions regarding the reporting of
methods employed. The final criterion for different study designs
can be found in the supplementary material (see Table S2). The
quality assessment of each study can be found in the supplemen-
tary material. An overall rating was given to each study depending
on the number of questions with an affirmative answer. Studies
with affirmative answers for > 75% of questions were labelled
as good, those with 50-75% were labelled as fair and those with
less than 50% were labelled as poor.

Results

The initial search on all five databases yielded 7500 potentially
relevant studies. Following the removal of duplicates, 3435 studies
were screened by title and abstract. After a first screening based on
he title and abstract, we excluded 3300 results and screened the
ull text of 135 studies for inclusion. In total, eight case-control
studies matched our inclusion criteria and were included in the
inal systematic review (Refs 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37).
The flow diagram of the screening and selection procedure can
be found in Figure 1.

Characteristics of the included studies

[he included articles explored in total 455 patients and 380 con-
trols. Participants were either individuals infected with
SARS-CoV-2 who then recovered or healthy controls, with no evi-
dence of infection. The smallest study included 14 participants
(Ref. 32), while the largest study included 261 participants
(Ref. 30). Five out of eight studies were of fair quality (Refs 31,
33, 34, 35, 37) while three studies were of poor quality (Refs 30,
32, 36). Studied populations were rather heterogeneous. Two
studies included participants who were infected at least four
weeks before (PACS). The other six studies included participants
who were infected three months or more before (long-COVID).
In two of these six, persistent symptoms were related to an
acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Two other studies
included both subjects with and without evidence of lung compli-
cations, in the patient group. No studies explored chromatin
accessibility or histone modifications. Six studies explored DNA
methylation, (Refs 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35) while two studies mea-
sured circulating miRNAs, both of them in ARDS-related symp-
toms (Refs 36, 37). Figure 2 summarizes the overall quality of
the present systematic review. For details on the risk of bias assess-
ment for each study, information can be found in Tables $3 (see
Supplementary Material).

Synthesis of the evidence

Given the nature of the data extracted, the heterogeneity of the
included samples, the methodological differences, and the

https://doi.org/10.1017/erm.2024.32 Published online by Cambridge University Press

different outcome measures, quantitative synthesis using
meta-analysis was not possible. Hence, guidelines for synthesis
without meta-analysis (SWiM) (Ref. 38) were used to report
results in narrative form as an alternative to meta-analysis.

The results are reported in Table 1. Table 1 shows the charac-
teristics of the included studies, and specifies the population
included, the findings pertaining to the epigenetics of patients,
and the overall study quality, with a comment describing the
most relevant criticism of the study.

DNA methylation

In total, six studies focussed on DNA methylation changes in peo-
ple with persistent symptoms after COVID-19. Three of them
enrolled patients with a combination of PACS (<12 weeks post-
infection) and long-COVID (>12 weeks post infection).
Mongelli and colleagues enrolled a group of patients who
reported symptoms for at least 4 weeks after infection. They mea-
sured DeltaAge - a marker of biological age acceleration based on
DNA methylation of specific targeted genes (Ref. 39), telomere
length and ACE2 expression in peripheral blood. They found evi-
dence for age acceleration, especially in younger individuals, sig-
nificant telomere shortening and reduced ACE2 expression
(Ref. 30). Huoman et al. (2021) (Ref. 31) used a genome-wide
approach and identified an overrepresentation of the signalling
pathways of Wnt, muscarinic and acetylcholine receptors, and
the gonadotropin-releasing hormone pathway (Ref. 31). Yin and
colleagues discovered DMRs in transposable elements and genes
related to immune and stress responses indicating mild activation
of TEs and incomplete recovery of immune-related genes
(Ref. 32).

The study by Lee and collegues (Ref. 33) started from a large
cohort and performed multiple comparison. One comparison is
between patients with PACS (8-12 weeks post infection, with evi-
dence of positive RT-PCR, n=110), and controls (n =73). The
control group included both healthy controls and symptomatic
patients, who all had a negative RT-PCR and no evidence of
COVID-19 persistence. They measured DNA methylation using
a genome-wide approach, and epigenetic age acceleration
(EAA), according to a published algorithm (Ref. 40). They
found three hypomethylated CpGs located in IFI44L and
ANKRD9 genes, that are involved in innate immune activation
and Class 1 MHC-mediated antigen processing and presentation,
respectively. However, contrary to the findings by Mongelli and
colleagues (Ref. 30), they did not find any evidence of age accel-
eration (Ref. 33). Two main differences should be reported
between the two studies. First, Mongelli et al. included patients
at an earlier stage (from 4 weeks on), while Lee et al. included
patients with persistent symptoms of at least 8 weeks. Second,
some of the patients included in Mongelli et al.’s study showed
lung involvement. On the contrary, people with respiratory tract
infection - not due to COVID-19, were in the control group in
Lee’s study.

Focussing on long-COVID, Lee et al. also compared patients
who were symptomatic at least 3 months after infection with par-
ticipants who were infected but recovered. No between-group dif-
ferences were found. Of note, patients were assigned to the
long-COVID or control group based on one question only of
the SF-36 questionnaires, namely Self-reported health somewhat
or much worse than a year-ago.

The other two studies measuring DNA methylation enrolled
patients with long-COVID (>12 weeks after infection). Nikesié
et al. (2022) (Ref. 34) found significant differences in DNA
methylation in three genes: SNORD3B, CETP and DLGAPI.
Such genes are involved in several biological pathways, including

increased levels of miR-21 and gene transcripts such as TGF-£,

(Ref. 36). miR-21 had high diagnostic value, as it was able to dif-

files associated with radiologic features (miR-9, miR-24, miR-221,

miR-495, miR-146a) capacity in ARDS patients (Ref. 37).

Discussion

To our knowledge, the present systematic review is the first
attempt to summarize findings on epigenetic changes associated
with PACS and long-COVID. The first and most important find-
ing is lack of homogeneity in the patient populations included.
The World Health Organisation specifies that long-COVID
occurs when symptoms persist for over three months from initial
infection and an alternative explanation for those symptoms can-
not be found (Ref. 5). However, other groups describe PACS and
long-COVID as a multi-organ disease, where evidence of pul-
monary, cardiovascular or nervous system alterations are consid-
ered part of the disease (Ref. 10). This is important, as some of the
included studies included patients with evidence of lung involve-
ment such as ARDS (Refs 36, 37). Though ARDS was a conse-
quence of Sars-CoV-2 infection and persisted for over 12 weeks,
it represents a possible explanation for symptoms. Therefore, in
such cases the diagnosis of PACS or long-COVID should not
be made. In other cases, authors included individuals with and
without evidence of pneumonia and/or upper respiratory tract
involvement in the same patient group (Refs 30, 32). In these
cases, drawing a valid conclusion becomes difficult. A precise
reporting of the clinical presentation is crucial - different
mechanisms can be at play in different clinical presentations.
We urge future research to apply strict inclusion criteria and pro-
vide a comprehensive clinical characterization of participants.
This would minimize heterogeneity and provide a tailored
approach based on mechanism-based subgroups.

Similarly, controls should be precisely defined. In some stud-
ies, controls were people who got infected by the virus, but
then recovered. In others, controls were healthy participants
with no evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, or recruited before
the COVID-19 pandemic. We argue that the latter control groups
are less relevant for studies investigating the development of
long-COVID.

The second relevant result is that research focussing on the
epigenetics of PACS and long-COVID is scarce and mostly of
low quality. Sample sizes are generally quite small, and the clinical
description of the included populations is rather superficial. In
addition, different studies used different biological matrices
and/or methods to explore the same mechanism (e.g. Illumina
array-based assays vs. whole-genome bisulphite sequencing for
DNA methylation). In fact, different studies showed different
results, and firm conclusions cannot be drawn on the exact under-
lying epigenetic mechanisms.

https://doi.org/10.1017/erm.2024.32 Published online by Cambridge University Press

However, the present synthesis of the literature does point
towards some epigenetic mechanisms that can be relevant in
PACS and long-COVID. With the exception of Mongelli et al
(Ref. 30), which used pyrosequencing in targeted genes to assess
biological age of the participants, the other five studies measuring
DNA methylation used array-based technology to study whole-
genome DNA methylation. Whole-genome DNA methylation
allows for a broad, explorative analyses of the DNA methylome.
They require high-level bioinformatic analyses and the results
depend at least partially by the algorithm employed for analyses.
In addition, the sample size needed to detect small-medium effect
sizes is normally very large, and it is not the case for the studies
included in the present systematic review. The studies included
here were able to only detect changes with large effect size, at
best. Precise replication between different studies is unlikely in
this scenario. However, the included studies provide some results
that are in line with one another. All studies identified significant
differential DNA methylation patterns between patients and con-
trols in several genes. The exact patterns differ from study to study
but they can be summarized as related to the immune system
(IFI44L and ANKRD9 genes, histamine and T-cell activation
pathways, etc.), the autonomic nervous system (muscarinic acetyl-
choline receptor and angiotensin II signalling), and cell metabol-
ism (WNT pathway, DLGAP1 and PI3 kinases, ERK signalling
and mitochondrial function). Other changes in DNA methylation
are less related to specific mechanisms, but rather represent wide-
spread changes in the epigenome. These are changes in biological
age and differential methylation in LINE-1 regions. Finally,
patients with PACS might show evidence of biological age accel-
eration, but this seems be more relevant in PACS associated with
pulmonary involvement (Ref. 30), rather than long-COVID
(Ref. 33). Taken together, these findings are promising but not
conclusive and more research should attempt to replicate them.

One last finding is that individuals with long-COVID due to
lung abnormalities show upregulation of miRNAs involved in
fibrotic, cell death, vascularization, thrombosis and inflammation-
related pathways. ARDS increases pulmonary vascular permeabil-
ity, inflammation and loss of aerated lung tissue. Dysregulated
inflammation along with coagulation and profibrotic pathway
activation has been implicated in the pathophysiology of ARDS
(Ref. 41). Both studies that investigated long-COVID-associated
lung injury assessed miRNA expression (Refs 36, 37). Ali and col-
leagues focused specifically on circulating levels of miR-21 - a
miRNA involved in fibroblast activation and lung fibrosis
(Ref. 42) and found it to be significantly increased. Their observa-
tion was also corroborated by the study by Garcia-Hidalgo and
colleagues in their sample. Though they employed a more
explorative approach, including 41 miRNAs in their analyses,
they found that higher levels of miR-21 were associated with
lung function.

Such findings point towards the importance of patient sub-
grouping and stratification. When studies focus on homogenous
subgroups (in this case patients with long-COVID associated
with lung abnormalities), results can be replicated and inform
uture research. Over 100 symptoms have been reported by
patients with long-COVID, making long-COVID a very heter-
ogenous syndrome (Ref. 9). Subgrouping patients based on clin-
ical presentation or putative pathophysiological mechanisms will
likely increase the power of statistical analyses and the chances
to identify targetable underlying mechanisms. Observations
rom other populations already showed that epigenetic changes
can successfully contribute to stratify patients into more homoge-
neous subgroups (Ref. 43).

Lastly, we believe it is relevant to note that symptoms of most
patients with long-COVID very closely resemble the ones
described in another condition - myalgic encephalomyelitis/


--- Page 8 ---
chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). ME/CFS is in fact character-
ized by unexplained, profound fatigue, sleep and cognitive distur-
bances and PESE (Ref. 44). Many patients suffering from ME/CFS
report their symptoms to have started after a viral infection
(Ref. 44). The similarity is striking. Research on long-COVID
can learn a lot from the knowledge obtained from studies on
ME/CES over the past decades (Ref. 45). In turn, current research
on long-COVID will benefit patients with ME/CFS (Ref. 46).
Given the expected huge prevalence of long-COVID (and thus
the possibility to recruit patients for research purposes), results
from studies on patients with long-COVID should be widely
transferred to the ME/CFS field (Ref. 46).

The findings of this review should be considered in light of its
limitations. As previously mentioned, sample sizes were often
small and study quality was generally low. Heterogeneity in meth-
ods and sample characteristics exist among the included studies.
The timing of the follow-up and assessment is also crucial, espe-
cially for studying DNA methylation, which is time-dependent
and decreases with age. Individual variabilities in disease presen-
tation, the stage of recovery, and variability in the follow-up mea-
surements make it hard to understand pathophysiological
mechanisms and their association to disease progression.

In addition, there are various important covariates that might
affect both the disease trajectory and epigenetic mechanisms
which are not always controlled for in the studies. Age, sex, medi-
cation used, comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, smok-
ing, obesity, etc. may alter epigenetics, especially DNA
methylation and should be controlled for (Refs 47, 48, 49).
Moreover, the treatment patients received during their acute
infection might play a role in deciding the trajectory of these
patients and must be considered during statistical analysis
(Ref. 50). Finally, all included studies were case-control studies,
and cross-sectional in nature. While such designs can provide
relevant information, longitudinal studies are better at character-
izing the dynamics of epigenetics and should be preferred.

Conclusion

Epigenetic changes might help the understanding of PACS and
long-COVID, elucidate their underlying mechanisms, aid sub-
grouping and point towards tailored treatments. Preliminary evi-
dence is promising but scarce. We urge future research to employ
longitudinal, repeated-measures designs, aim for the best possible
methodological quality (following published guidelines on con-
ducting and reporting clinical research, eg (Ref. 51) or
https://www.equator-network.org/), and provide a comprehensive,
precise clinical characterization of the included population in
order to provide valid and reliable findings. A better understand-
ing of PACS and long-COVID is urgently needed, given the high
prevalence of these conditions and the benefits that such research
can transfer to other high-burden diseases such as ME/CFS.

Abstract-In this year, COVID-19 and Severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Coy-2) became a major public
health issue. After countless researchers’ efforts, many biological
properties of SARS-Cov-2 and infection pathways have been
deciphered. Nevertheless, there are currently many unresolved
issues. For instance, the disparity between the severity of the
symptoms brought by SARS-Cov-2 is one of these issues. Because
it is believed that many biological pathways are the results of the
interplay between genetic and epigenetic pathways, this article
seeks to explain the these unsolved issues by analyzing the data
associated with hosts’ epigenetic regulation. Considering the
importance of Angiotensin converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) and the
frequent presence of comorbidities in critically ill patients, the
article hypothesizes that it is the comorbidities that bring the

changes in host epigenome and cause a severe form of COVID-19.

The purpose of this paper is to make a thorough inquiry about
whether the comorbidities bring he changes in host epigenome
and cause a severe form of COVID-19. After randomly searching
and analyzing many data papers, many evidences are found to
support this idea. Therefore, this paper hypothesizes that it is the
comorbidities cause the changes in host epigenome and
exacerbates the symptoms led by COVID-19. Based upon this
hypothesis, there are many potential treatment options and
implications to the public health system.

I. INTRODUCTION

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 has posed
a great threat to human health. In spite of the great
accomplishments made by the globally collaborative efforts,
many unfathomed problems still exist. For instance, the
diversity in the severity of the symptoms caused by
SARS-Cov-2 demonstrates a more in-depth understanding of
the biological mechanisms of this novel Coronavirus is still
urgently needed [1]. This diversity in symptoms definitely has
numerous contributing factors. The role of epigenetic
mechanisms is one that needs further explore and analyze.
Angiotensin converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) type I can be a great
candidate for the study of epigenetic mechanisms in
SARS-Cov-2. The reason lies in the fact that it plays a crucial
role in the viral entry to the host cell and the expression of it is
thought to be highly correlated with COVID-19. Besides, it has
been found that the chief risk factors associated with a severe
form of COVID-19 are certain comorbidities, including lupus,
some cancers, and diabetes mellitus, as shown in Table 1

[17,18]. This finding gives a hint to study the correlation of
ACE2 expression and these complications. Therefore, this
article hypothesizes that the major changes in epigenetic
regulations caused by these comorbidities are responsible to
exacerbate COVID-19. In the following parts, this article seeks
to find whether this hypothesis can be validated or not.

Il. IMPORTANT ROLES OF ACE2 IN SARS-CoV-2
INFECTION

After several special cases of pneumonia was found in
Wuhan, China at the end of 2019, this novel type of pneumonia
spread to other provinces in China in an outrageous way. Later,
this new type of pneumonia was found to be highly related to a
unique coronavirus, which was named as 2019nCoV by World
Health Organization and later renamed as severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronaviruse-2(SARS- CoV-2).

Previous studies have found many factors at the host cell
which are related to viral entry. Angiotensin converting
Enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the one that this article attaches great
importance to discuss.

Heretofore, researchers performed extensive analysis of
clinical specimens. Later, it was found ACE2 expressed in
enterocytes of the small intestine, in alveolar cells of lung, and
in smooth muscle cells of a wide range of organs seemed to be
very active in clinical samples from patients with COVID-19
[2]. Apart from this evidence, another research which studied
the infection of epithelial cells demonstrated that hardly can
SARS- CoV-2 infect the undifferentiated epithelial cells
expressing a low level of ACE2, as shown in Table | [3].

Generally speaking, ACE2 is a metalloenzyme containing a
peptidase M2 domain and an amino acid transported domain
that generally binds with SARS-CoV-2. Normally, it takes an
important role in cleaving phenylalanine residue and producing
vasodilator angiotensin. However, when the host cells make
contact with SARS-CoV-2, ACE2 plays a significant role in
viral binding. As a result, the reason underlies the fact that
human can be effectively infected by SARS-CoV-2 is that
there are two hot spots for viral binding in human ACE2.
Moreover, frequent mutations at receptor-binding motifs can
also be regarded as the chief culprit of human infection since
these mutations typically occur near the two hot spots. For
instance, NS501T mutation which can boost the binding
capacity of SARS-CoV-2 is one of this kind of mutations [4].

Changes in the epigenetic regulations of ACE2 gene cause
the exacerbation of COVID-19. Many of human bodies’
biological properties are results of the coaction between
epigenetic and genetic mechanisms. Human’s immunity of this
novel virus, SARS- CoV-2, is therefore not an exception. There
are numerous scientific evidences to demonstrate the
correctness of this idea.

For instance, by studying the epigenetic regulation of IFN-y,
an important interferon in antiviral activities, in patients with

coronaviruses, it has been found that MERS-CoV utilizes DNA
methylation to decrease host cells’ potency of antigen
presentation, as shown in Table 2 [5]. This discovery suggests
the possibility that SARS- CoV-2, a coronavirus sharing many
similarities with MERS-CoV, also maneuvers host’ immune
system and therefore increases the possibility for the virus to
spread by changing the host’s epigenome.

to the changes in host epigenome. Considering the significance
of ACE2 mentioned above, this article chooses lung tissue to
study, because there are many genes locating in the human lung
that regulate ACE2. These genes include the ones that directly
relate to some important epigenetic enzymes that enable the
successful viral entry.

In a study, researchers found out that some hosts’
epigenome was altered when they were studying the lung
tissues of the patients with SARS-CoV-2 and the comorbidity,
the type 2 diabetes [6]. These alterations encompass an obvious
increment of the regulation of a histone deacetylase, SIRT1,
and histone modifications of H3K27Ac, H3K4mel, H3K4me?
in ACE2 genes, all of which affect human genome by
increasing ACE2 expression.

Moreover, a previous study can also readily indicate the
sexual difference in terms of the severity of symptoms led by
SARS-CoV-2 [7]. From preceding epidemiological studies,
males are more prone to be infected by SARS-CoV-2 than
females, as shown in Table 3 [8,17]. From a cohort study
showing the correlation between gender and health outcome,
the fact males are more likely to become smokers is shown, as
shown in Table 4 [9]. As a result, it is possible to attribute this
sex disparity to smoking. It can also be inferred that smoking
may use a similar mechanism, changing the epigenetic
regulation of ACE2 gene, as what has done by some
comorbidities in human lung, considering smoking’s
well-known impact on altering human genomes by DNA
methylation [10]. In that study, a meta-analysis of DNA
methylation was conducted. By using the Illumina BeadChip

450K, researchers assessed the DNA _ methylation on
participants in 16 cohort studies which included 2433 current
smokers and 6956 people who never smoked before. By

comparing these two groups, it turned out that 2636 CpGs,
1405 genes, were differentially methylated in a significant
manner under Bonferrni threshold ( P-value < 1x 10°’).

hospitals within 30 provinces 58% (8]

In order to have a comprehensive understanding of the finding can further support the hypothesis that comorbidities
impact brought by the comorbidities on hosts' epigenome, only can alter the epigenetic regulation of ACE2 in hosts, and thus

focusing on patients’ lung tissues is not a compelling idea.
Fortunately, a study utilizes co-expression analysis of ACE2
provides the big picture [11]. By conducting Pearson
correlation to find genes related to ACE2 and adopting FDR
correction to prove the significance of the data, the team
successfully find several genes which seem can affect the
expression of ACE2. These genes included 544 genes with
positive relation and 173 genes with negative correlations. One
of these genes, lysine demethylase 5B (KDMS5B) demands
great attention. In an earlier research, patients with breast
carcinoma experiences an increment of KDMS5B histone
demethylase and the boost of the expression of ACE2 [6].
KDMSB is a great candidate to explain the boost. Known to all,
the chromatin accessibility is highly related to KDMS5B. To be
specific, during transcription, KDMSB is one that can lead the
deportation of di-methylation and tri-methylation, two basic
chromatin markers, from the lysine 4 of histone H3.

As breast carcinoma has been proven to be a comorbidity
altering host epigenome with the presence of SARS- CoV-2,
whether other cancers can have the same effect becomes an
intriguing question. In a study, besides breast carcinoma,
endometrial carcinoma and kidney renal papillary cell
carcinoma are also confirmed to be highly correlated with an
increased ACE2 expression [12]. This discovery was found by
using TIMER in TCGA database (*P-value <0.05, **P-value
<0.01, ***P-value <0.001). The reason probably underlies in
the fact that these two diseases are able to decrease the DNA
methylation of ACE2 promoter, leading increased ACE2
expression and causing a change in hosts’ epigenome. This

improve the chance for SARS- CoV-2 to spread.

II. POTENTIAL TREARMENT OPTIONS

The fierce spread of SARS-CoV-2 forced countless
scientists to spare no efforts in developing novel treatments,
but most of the current treatments inevitably had some
downsides. First, there was some ingenious treatments focusing
on hindering the viral entry. For example, scientist used the
existing neutralizing antibodies targeting on the receptor
binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV. However, it is reported
that although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV share great
homology, about 75.5%, many epitopes in the novel virus was
different from SARS-CoV, revealing an urgent need to develop
new antibodies, as shown in Table 5 [13]. Apart from this
category of treatments, some researchers attach great important
on disrupting the replication of SARS-CoV. Remdesivir is the
most compelling antiviral drug in this division, but there is not
sufficient data to validate its efficacy. In addition, because
patients with a severe form of symptoms always suffered
cytokine storm, some scientists conceived up using
corticosteroids which can suppress dysfunctional inflammation
to make them get rid of this life-threatening danger.
Nevertheless, NHC guidelines totally deprecates the using
corticosteroids in a systematic manner, implying the risk of this
treatment. Even though there are more than 15 candidates for
the vaccine, for the sake of safety, they are currently all
undergoing clinical trials and none of them have been on the
market yet.

readers which can identify chromatin with acetylation, has been
proved to play a crucial role in latent viral life [14]. Scientists
could test whether the treatments with BET inhibitors are
effective in this virus, SARS-CoV. Last but not least, it has
been found numerous compounds in nature, such as
methyltransferase inhibitor curcumin and sulforaphane can
elicit the epigenetic silencing of ACE2 genes [15]. On the
grounds that epigenetic regulations of ACE2 genes are
important in viral entry, scientists should find more of these
compounds.

IV. IMPLICATIONS TO PUBLIC HEALTH
MANAGEMENT

Considering the high rates of spread, COVID-19 can
definitely be seen as a huge threat to the public health system.
Luckily, countries all over the world have spared no efforts in
curbing the spread of the virus and all of them have made
accomplishments. However, the deficiency of medical supplies,
such as ventilators, made some critically ill patients could not
receive proper treatment. This predicament was probably
caused by the fact that some patients with mild symptoms used
too many resources. The reason why the government could not
have a sagacious use of the supplies was that they could not
predict which patients would confront life-threatening
symptoms.

In this circumstance, this article will give some great advice.
The current public health surveillance system, the data
collection system, remains immature. For instance, United
States of America currently only collected basic data, such as
hospitalizations, death, visits to emergency departments via the
existing influenza surveillance systems and National Vital
Statistics System. In contrast, as the close relationship between
the severity of the symptoms and the presence of comorbidities
was demonstrated previously, the government should also
collect the comorbidities patients have through the surveillance
systems. In this way, they could categorize which patients need
intensive treatment, thereby wisely allocating the medical
supplies.

V. CONCLUSION

Through the discussion in the paragraphs above, it has been
proven that the reason why patients with both comorbidities
and SARS-CoV-2 are more likely be infected and have a
severe form of symptoms is that the hosts’ epigenome are
altered in this case and makes the hosts’ immune system more
susceptible to the virus than usual. On the basis of this
hypothesis, the article proposes some novel the treatment
options which focus on the epigenetic regulation of ACE2
genes. Many implications to the public health policies are also
mentioned, including the one that incorporates patients’
comorbidities into the surveillance system. Although this
hypothesis is validated to a certain degree, more clinical data
are urgently needed to support this hypothesis. In addition,
there are still some unsolved questions require further
investigation. For instance, when the viruses attach the S
proteins on cells’ surfaces, protease TMPRSS2 plays an
important role. Thus, whether the epigenetic regulations of the
gene related to TMPRSS2 are significant in the viral life cycle
becomes an intriguing question that needs further exploration.

mostly supervised machine learning methods.

Background
Clinical epigenetics is a promising field of research. There
is evidence that DNA methylation changes at cytosine-
phosphate-guanine (CpG) sites are associated with disease
development [1-3]. Beyond genetic background, DNA
methylation may additionally reflect environmental expo-
sures and could improve diagnostic accuracy and prog-
nostic prediction of certain diseases and be targetable by
personalised therapy in the future [4, 5].

The current medical environment is characterised by
collection of vast amounts of patient, hospital, and

Background: Machine learning is a sub-field of artificial intelligence, which utilises large data sets to make
predictions for future events. Although most algorithms used in machine learning were developed as far back as
the 1950s, the advent of big data in combination with dramatically increased computing power has spurred
renewed interest in this technology over the last two decades.

Main body: Within the medical field, machine learning is promising in the development of assistive clinical tools
for detection of e.g. cancers and prediction of disease. Recent advances in deep learning technologies, a sub-
discipline of machine learning that requires less user input but more data and processing power, has provided
even greater promise in assisting physicians to achieve accurate diagnoses.

Within the fields of genetics and its sub-field epigenetics, both prime examples of complex data, machine learning
methods are on the rise, as the field of personalised medicine is aiming for treatment of the individual based on

Conclusion: We now have an ever-growing number of reported epigenetic alterations in disease, and this offers a
chance to increase sensitivity and specificity of future diagnostics and therapies. Currently, there are limited studies
using machine learning applied to epigenetics. They pertain to a wide variety of disease states and have used

administrative data [6, 7], which makes traditional ap-
proaches to investigating these data individually less ideal.
Machine learning (ML), however, is able to integrate large
and complex data sets [8]. These data sources have the
potential to enhance patient care and outcomes. A perso-
nalised medicine approach is tightly connected to in-
creases in omics-data. For example, DNA sequence
databases double in size twice a year [9]. Indeed, the in-
creases in computer processing coupled with the rapid re-
duction in the cost of genomic sequencing have outpaced
the rate of computing hardware advances [10]. Whilst far
from a panacea, ML may be a tool to assist physicians in
interpreting information-rich clinical data, including those
collected in epigenetic studies [11, 12].

This review was guided by the question, “What are the
machine learning models that utilize DNA methylation to
classify or diagnose disease states?” This review focused
on three key aspects within the search strategy, namely,
the data science technique, the biomedical technique, and
the outcome of interest. The search strategy involved two
databases, namely, PubMed and Google Scholar. The
search string for the PubMed database was as follows:
(‘machine learning’ OR ‘artificial intelligence’) AND (“epi-
genetic*” OR “DNA methylation”) AND (“classification”
OR “diagnosis”). For Google Scholar, the terms machine
learning, artificial intelligence, epigenetic, DNA methyla-
tion, classification, and diagnosis were utilized. Following
the identification of key articles, references in the identi-
fied articles were checked to further identify relevant lit-
erature (1 = 1). Once selected, all literature was evaluated
for the type of ML utilized, the type of DNA methylation
technique used, ML performance measures, validation
technique, and the number of samples and number of
controls in testing sets and validation sets.

This review is written in the context of the concurrent
burgeoning interest for the medical practitioner in po-
tential clinical applications of epigenetics and ML. The
first aim of this review is to provide a brief overview of
epigenetics, followed by its clinical application potentials.
The second aim is to provide a brief summary of the
current state of ML and its application to the field of
epigenetics and personalised medicine. Finally, section
three delves into future directions that may be of value
to scientists and physicians looking to harness the power
of ML in epigenetics. As the field of ML is likely to find
widespread application in clinical practice via diagnostic
tools, this review aims to be a brief guide to the current
state of ML in epigenetics.

Epigenetics and its clinical potential
Epigenetics, sometimes described as the study of heritable
changes in gene expression that occur without a change in
DNA sequence [13], is postulated to be the product of a
complex interaction between an individual’s genotype, age,
and lifestyle factors such as diet, alcohol consumption, and
smoking [14-17]. In 1942, the term “epigenetics” was first
coined by Conrad H Waddington [18]. The word is derived
from the Greek word “epigenesis”, and initially described
the influences of genetic processes on development [18].
Several diseases have been shown to be associated
with differential DNA methylation including various
cancers, obesity, and cardiovascular disease [19-23].
Broadly, four major categories of epigenetic changes
exist: DNA methylation, RNA-centred mechanisms (in-
cluding non-coding RNAs and microRNAs), histone
modifications, and chromatin conformation [24]. Of
these, DNA methylation is the most commonly studied
epigenetic modification in mammals, particularly

Page 2 of 11

methylation of a cytosine molecule adjacent to a guan-
ine molecule [25]. The cytosine-guanine dinucleotide is
referred to as a CpG site and these sites often occur in
clusters termed CpG islands [26].

One of the most popular methods of measuring genome-
wide DNA methylation profiles is through microarrays,
chiefly the Illumina HumanMethylation Infinium BeadArray
27]. Each generation of the Illumina technology has been as-
sociated with diminishing cost and a larger portion of the
genome measured, with the number of CpG sites measured
from ~ 27,000 [28] to ~ 450 000 [29] and most recently to ~
850,000 with the EPIC array [30]. Other techniques, such as
yrosequencing and methyl-sensitive endonuclease restric-
tion, are potentially more accurate than the Illumina
HumanMethylation microarray technique, but only suitable
‘or low-throughput studies, as they are also very time-
consuming [27]. Therefore, whilst the Illumina microarray
as limitations, it is still one of the most widely used DNA
methylation techniques in the epigenetic field [27, 31].

A recent review in Nature Review Genetics gives a
comprehensive overview of the clinical potential of epi-
genetics [32]. Epigenetics is closely linked to environ-
mental influences and hence potentially better suited to
disease diagnosis and treatment than genetics alone [32].
As epigenetics has been shown to play a role in the me-
diation between early life adverse environments and later
life disease onset, it has a potential role for early diagno-
sis [33]. It has been shown that adverse early life, such
as famine [34] or exposure to maternal smoking during
pregnancy [15, 35], can program the development of the
child mediated on an epigenetic level [36].

However, the biggest successes to date in using epi-
genetic information as a biomarker have been achieved
in oncology, where biomarkers have been approved by
the US Food and Drug Administration [37]. One such
example is the "SEPT9 biomarker for colorectal cancer,
which has been discovered in 2003 and is now a com-
mercialized kit that can diagnose colorectal cancer in
blood plasma based on epigenetic markers [37].

To date, ML has yielded limited biomarkers that have
made it into current clinical practice. However, it is
likely that in the upcoming decades the application of
ML to the epigenome [38] will yield many more poten-
tial biomarkers and drug targets, particularly because
ML is optimized to find meaning in large and complex
data sets. In genomics and transcriptomics, ML methods
are already used for example in gene set enrichment
analysis, to find highly overrepresented pathways [39].

Overview of machine learning and systematic
literature review for machine learning in

functions such as problem-solving and decision-making
[40]. AI includes fields such as natural language process-
ing, expert system, robotics, and ML [41]. The various
biomedical applications of AI fields other than ML is be-
yond the scope of the current review, and substantial re-
views are available elsewhere [40, 42-44]. As previously
mentioned, one subdiscipline of AI that shows strong
potential in the field of data-driven medical fields is that
of ML [11, 45].

ML enables computers to learn and make predictions
by finding patterns within the data [40]. With increased
amounts of data available, ML approaches become more
adept at pattern prediction, a factor that makes ML par-
ticularly suited to data-rich medical fields like genomics
and its sub-field epigenetics. ML algorithms are gener-
ally categorised into supervised, unsupervised, and deep
learning. A simplified visual representation of the rela-
tionship between these fields is presented in Fig.

Within the field, there are some essential concepts that
clinicians ought to be familiar with when considering
ML. A simplified approach to steps for developing and
applying an ML algorithm is outlined in Fig. 2. A sug-
gested processing pipeline is to split the available data
into three sub data sets: a training data set, where the se-
lected algorithm is optimised and the parameters are
evaluated, a test data set, where the performance of the
trained algorithm is evaluated, and a validation data set,
which ideally comes from a different source than the
training and test data set. This last step, the validation, is
not always possible due to unavailability of data but

Page 3 of 11

allows for a more robust estimation of the algorithm
performance beyond the training data set. A good alter-
native for this is k-fold cross-validation. This means,
during the training process, the data is randomly split
into k training and test sets, which allows for a good ap-
proximation of the external validity of the model [46].
Common performance measures employed in classifica-
tion tasks that use balanced data sets for training are ac-
curacy, sensitivity, specificity, and precision [47, 48]. For
imbalanced data sets (low number of cases versus con-
trols), more robust performance evaluators that take into
account class distribution are more appropriate, for ex-
ample, F,-score, area under the curve (AUC), and
Cohen’s Kappa [47-49].

Supervised learning

Supervised learning is a subset of ML where labels to a
dataset are known, for example, cancer patients versus
healthy controls, which is subsequently used to train an
algorithm that can make predictions about the health
outcome on unseen data, without knowing the disease
status [11, 40]. This form of ML is reliant on user input
to categorise the different instances in the learning
process. Supervised learning algorithms have been ef-
fectively utilised in classification and prediction tasks
[50]. Commonly used algorithms within this category of
ML include linear or logistic regression, support vector
machine, random forest algorithms, and least absolute
shrinkage and selection operator regression (LASSO)
[40]. Briefly, support vector machine is based on the

idea that by transforming the data, eventually it will be
possible to separate classes by a hyperplane, which in
the two-dimensional space is a simple line [51]. The
points nearest to this hyperplane are called support
vectors and are essential for the classification [51]. A
Random Forest algorithm is a decision tree-based
model, that builds up a multitude of decision trees of
differing depth [52]. Further, for every tree, a random
subset of the data set is utilised and at every split in the
decision tree, a random subset of the features is used.
This makes every decision tree in the forest highly un-
correlated to the next and the final predictor, which is
an average of the whole ensemble of trees, will be
highly unbiased [52]. Finally, LASSO is a logistic regres-
sion based model that also performs feature selection,
meaning the most important variables for prediction
are selected from the data set via a so-called penaliza-
tion model that weighs the features depending on their
effect [40]. For further information and details on the
algorithms, please refer to the original publications
referenced here [40, 51, 52].

Examples of supervised learning using epigenetic data
include classification of metastatic brain tumours, prostate
cancer, coronary heart disease, neurodevelopmental syn-
dromes, and central nervous system tumours [53-57].
This review focuses on supervised learning, as this is
mostly used when trying to develop a diagnostic test to as-
sist clinicians in the diagnostic process (examples: Tabl 1).

Whilst supervised learning provides a robust method
by which to classify diseases versus healthy individuals,
there are inherent limitations. Firstly, supervised learning
usually requires user input in order to define training

classes (or classify the disease and healthy patients) to
develop a model [40]. Secondly, since ML algorithms are
sensitive to the quality of the data, it is essential that
they be correctly labelled [40]. If the training data has
examples that are incorrectly labelled, the supervised
learning classifier will make incorrect predictions [40].
Finally, supervised learning is susceptible to ‘over-fit-
ting’—the tendency to work very well on the training
data but having limited performance on other external
data sets [58]. Despite these limitations, supervised
learning is one of the most widely used ML techniques
in classification and prediction in epigenetics (Table 1).

Another class type of algorithm that can be used in su-
pervised ML is deep learning. Deep learning algorithms
are capable of processing high volume, high-
dimensionality data—data with a high number of vari-
able input sources—and identifying complex patterns
[59]. For epigenetics, deep learning provides an enticing
avenue to explore. Common deep learning techniques
include artificial neural networks and convolutional
neural networks [59, 60]. Historically, deep learning is
considered one of the more computationally expensive
types of AI, requiring large amounts of computing
power in order to be effective [59]. The advances of
computing power and high-speed internet in the last half
a decade has led to efficient and effective use of deep
learning, particularly through web-based (super-)com-
puting services such as Amazon Web Services, Google’s
Cloud service, and Microsoft Azure.

Perhaps the most problematic issue with deep learning
is the inability to identify precisely how the algorithm
has determined the outcome, known colloquially as

Area under the receiver operator
curve (ROC AUC)

Brief definition:

Accuracy is a classifier that works best on balanced data sets. It is a measure that informs about the correct
classifications out of all classifications. It can have values from 0 - 100 %

Example:

If we are dealing with a binary classification, e.g. cancer versus healthy, and we have 20 patients with cancer
and 80 healthy controls, a model accuracy of 80% would mean that the model classified every subject into the
majority class (healthy) and is completely unable to classify cancer patients, although the accuracy indicates a
good performance.

Brief definition:

The sensitivity is the true positive rate of a test. This means, how many subjects with a disease are actually
identified as having the disease by the test. The values range from 0 to 100%.

Example:

Let us say we have a epigenetic test, that claims to identify the presence of a specific type of cancer. When
evaluating the test, it was able to identify 30 out of 60 cancer patients correctly. The sensitivity of this test
would then be 50% (30/60)

Brief definition:

The specificity is the true negative rate of a test. In other words, it represents the proportion of people without
the disease, that will have a negative result. Just like for sensitivity, the values range from 0- 100%

Example:

We assume we are dealing with the same diagnostic test for cancer as in the explanation of sensitivity. Out of
90 healthy subjects, 70 had a negative diagnosis. This means the specificity of the test is 78% (70/90)

Brief definition:

Precision is a measure that tells us out of all predicted cases, how many are actual cases. Possible values range
from 0 to 1.

Example:

In the cancer example, how many predicted cancer cases are actual cancer cases.

Brief definition:

Recall is a measure that informs us how many cases we were able to identify as cases. The value range is 0 to
1.

Example:

Out of all the cancer patients, how many was the predictive model able to identify as cancer patients?

Brief definition:

The Fi-score is the harmonic mean between precision and recall. In this case, we aim for both high recall and
high precision, meaning we want to be able to identify a large amount of cases and we also want to be sure
that the majority of predicted cases are actual cases. The F1-score ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 is the worst
performance.

Example:

If we have a near-perfect precision and recall, meaning we ate able to classify a large amount of the cancer pa-
tients as cancer patients (recall) and we are sure that our prediction is correct (precision), the harmonic mean
between the two of them for a good model would be ~ 0.9.

Brief definition:

The area under the receiver operator curve is a measure of how sensitive and specific a test performs. In a
graphical representation, the x-axis depicts the negative predictions and the y-axis the positive predictions. If a
test performs bad in terms of sensitivity and specificity, the area under the curve would be 0.5, which means it
is not better than tossing a coin.

‘black-boxing’ [61]. Black-boxing is an especially signifi-
cant limitation in the medical context due to the impli-
cations on patient safety and ability to prove clinical
reasoning [61, 62].

Unsupervised learning

In contrast to supervised learning, unsupervised learning
does not require labels in order to work [40, 63]. How-
ever, whilst unsupervised algorithms provide strength of
correlation between individual variables within a data
set, they are unable to assign the potential biological
relevance and/or plausibility of these patterns of correl-
ation [40, 63]. Therefore, human input is required to as-
sess the biological plausibility and the salience of any

associated clusters identified by the algorithm [40, 63].
Common problems that unsupervised learning has been
used for include clustering and association tasks [40].
Clustering, as the name suggests, clusters data points ac-
cording to inherent groupings in the data. Common
methods used in unsupervised learning include k-means
clustering and hierarchical clustering, principle compo-
nent analysis, and partial least squares discriminant ana-
lysis [64, 65]. The latter two methods are often utilised in
dimensionality reduction, or the removal of random input
variables to increase the performance of a model [66].
Within an epigenetic context, unsupervised learning
can be used to detect DNA methylation patterns be-
tween diseased and non-diseased individuals, for

--- Page 6 ---

example, between breast cancer brain metastases sub-
types [38, 57]. Unsupervised learning algorithms are es-
pecially useful to detect patterns in data sets that have
large amounts of data points, such as those in micro-
array and omics data sets [66, 67].

The main limitation of unsupervised learning is that
the algorithms do not provide insight into the import-
ance or relevance of clustering and/or associations [68].
The concept of ‘correlation does not mean causation’ is
especially relevant to unsupervised ML. Due to the in-
ability of unsupervised ML algorithms to prescribe
meaning to associations, caution should be exercised
when interpreting any associations identified by an un-
supervised ML algorithm, as they may be data artefacts
as opposed to true biological effects. Furthermore, un-
supervised learning is sensitive to noise within the data
[40]. If there is a large amount of irrelevant data within
a data set, an unsupervised learning algorithm may clus-
ter points erroneously. Therefore, data used for unsuper-
vised learning must be carefully pre-processed to ensure
it is of high quality prior to analysis. Deep learning ap-
proaches can also be used for unsupervised tasks. An ex-
ample of a clinical application is a deep learning model
that was trained on unlabelled mammography images to
identify breast density scores which showed a very
strong positive relationship with manual scores, predict-
ive of breast cancer [69].

Epigenetics and machine learning: existing literature
Overall, 16 studies were identified that utilised ML to
diagnose or classify diseases [39, 54—58, 71-80).

There was extensive heterogeneity in the disease out-
comes, types of algorithms, performance measures, val-
idation methods, and sample sizes between studies.
Table 1 summarises the studies that have investigated
the use of ML for diagnosis or classification in various
cancers (” = 10), cerebral palsy (m = 1), neurodevelop-
mental syndromes (v = 1), coronary artery disease (m =
1), and BAFopathies (m = 1; disruption of the BRG1/
BRM-associated factor (BAF) complex has been linked
to several neurodevelopmental syndromes, commonly
referred to as BAFopathies). A special case where the
two identified deep learning approaches, DeepCpG and
DeepMethyl, as they both predicted methylation status
in the genome rather than a disease status [70, 71]
(Table 2).

The types of algorithms used have all been supervised
learning, including support vector machines (n = 7), ran-
dom forest (1 = 7), LASSO regression (n = 1), non-
metric multidimensional scaling ( = 1), logistic regres-
sion (m = 1), convolutional neural network ( = 1), and
stacked denoising autoencoder (m = 1). Of note, some
research used multiple models.

Page 6 of 11

The types of epigenetic data include microarray tech-
niques (n = 11), bisulphite sequencing (m = 3), and
methyl-sensitive restricted endonuclease (1 =1). Of these
collection methods, most studies used one type of DNA
methylation technique only (1 = 9), whilst others com-
bined measurement techniques, meaning Infinium
HumanMethylation 450K and EPIC or CHIP-Seq from
The Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) (n = 5).

From the selected publication, it appears that the two
most popular methods were support vector machine and
random forest. Based on the approaches identified, it
seems the most successful combination is 10-fold cross-
validation with either a random forest or support vector
machine for array-based methods and deep learning-
based models for prediction of the methylation status of
the DNA.

Epigenetic data have traits that make it amenable to
ML. Firstly, DNA methylation is usually both chemically
and biologically stable over time [5]. Consequently, the
measurement of DNA methylation allows for a reliable
measure of the chemical composition of the epigenome
at any given point in time. Secondly, large-scale, data-
rich repositories such as The Cancer Genome Atlas
(TCGA), ENCODE, and the BLUEPRINT consortium
provide large amounts of samples to employ comprehen-
sive, high-throughput statistical analyses of differentially
methylated regions with biological relevance [80-82].
These repositories may provide for the training data for
a ML algorithm, or an independent test set in order to
determine the ML algorithm’s external validity and sub-
sequent clinical utility [81, 83]. Since ML algorithms re-
quire large amounts of data to make accurate
predictions, the establishment of these databanks is a
significant milestone in the utility of AI in epigenetics.
Finally, most datasets consist of DNA methylation pro-
files derived from peripheral blood, meaning that pa-
tients will only be required to provide a small blood
sample. It should be noted that DNA methylation pro-
files are tissue-specific, and that the use of peripheral
blood as a measure of DNA methylation may be less
useful in diseases such as certain cancers [84], with more
clinical utility in diseases like obesity [85, 86].

Challenges and future perspectives

Whilst there are advantages to combining epigenetics
with ML to assist clinicians in the diagnostic process,
there are significant challenges that must be addressed.
First, very large datasets, requiring cross-jurisdiction col-
laboration are needed, especially if the diseases that need
prediction are rare. This problem occurs 2-fold in epi-
genetic data: initially with the patient to healthy control
ratio (with many datasets containing many more con-
trols as compared to disease cases) and secondly within
the individual methylomes, where there is a higher

proportion of sections in the DNA that are densely
methylated, referred to as differentially methylated re-
gions (DMR), compared to the number of non-DMR
sites [12, 87]. Second, most epigenetic data sets have
more variables than samples, making it difficult for many
ML algorithms to function effectively [88]. A potential
solution is to collect more data, something that collab-
orative data repositories are providing. Concurrent, care-
ful consideration of the type of algorithm and suitable
performance measures of the prediction should be made
to prevent erroneous data interpretations.

Third, not all associations in a DNA methylation data-
set are linear. Several CpGs may be linked to the same
gene which may influence other portions of the methy-
lome and transcriptome, which has particularly been
identified as an issue in gene set enrichment analysis
(89, 90]. Additionally, the Illumina HumanMethyla-
tion450 array only covers 2% of all CpG sites in the
methylome [27]. These challenges must be recognised
before the full clinical potential of epigenetics is realised.

Fourth, for proper development, improvement and
testing of novel machine learning approaches, it will be
crucial to increase efforts to make large epigenetic data-
sets publicly available. This should include the raw data
of different platforms, so research can be conducted into
the effect of different normalisation methods on ML
model performance and assessing which models work
best for array-based and bisulphite sequencing-based
data formats. One of the largest efforts in providing ac-
cess to sequencing data is provided by The National
Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). This in-
cludes databases such as the sequencing read archive
(SRA) that are invaluable for research into new compu-
tational methods [91]. The SRA is operated by the Inter-
national Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration
(INSDC) and was initially started to publicly deposit se-
quencing reads [91]. Currently, more and more funding
bodies and scientific journals request a deposition of ex-
periment data in the SRA, which is not only beneficial for
reproducibility of research, but also for efforts into the de-
velopment of new analytical tools. Resources such as SRA
made it possible to develop sequencing analysis tools such
as Magic-BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool),
which allows to align sequencing reads to a reference gen-
ome based on a sequencing database [92].

In an epigenetic context, deep learning has been used
to classify genetic mutations in gliomas and prediction
of single-cell DNA methylation status [71, 93]. Whilst
still in its infancy, applications of deep learning to classi-
fication tasks using DNA methylation data may have
benefits over traditional ML.

Another challenge for the field of ML is prediction
bias. Several cases in facial recognition, especially rele-
vant to deep learning because of their black box

Page 9 of 11

character, have shown that the predictive models are
biased towards populations of European ancestry [94].
Therefore, the challenge of getting representative data-
sets that do not exacerbate existing health differences
for disadvantaged populations is one of the biggest chal-
lenges that the ML community needs to address [95].

Conclusion

As an in-depth introduction to epigenetics and ML was
out of the scope of this review, we aimed to give an
overview of epigenetics and the potential of ML in clin-
ical applications. The interested reader may refer to the
cited literature on the different topics of epigenetics and
machine learning.

ML is starting to find patterns in ever-growing genetic
and epigenetic data sets that relate to the development
of diseases. Although very accurate, deep learning
methods will need to undergo further research to define
what is going on within the “black box”, before clinicians
can confidently make informed decisions whilst utilising
such tools. In the meantime, interpretable ML algo-
rithms are likely to be on the horizon with the potential
to assist in more confident diagnoses. Whilst ML is
sometimes depicted in the media and literature as a
threat to the clinician’s profession and autonomy, clini-
cians should perhaps view its application as an assistive
tool. ML can be used, just like evolving technologies
across the ages (from the stethoscope, to X-Rays, to
MRIs) as providing adjunctive information; it is a matter
of being properly informed about limitations of the
method of algorithm development and understanding
where and to whom it is appropriate to apply.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: The rapid development of high-throughput sequencing
technologies has enabled epigeneticists to quantify DNA methylation
on a massive scale. Progressive increase in sequencing capacity pre-
sent challenges in terms of processing analysis and the interpretation of
the large amount of data; investigating differential methylation between
genome-scale data from multiple samples highlights this challenge.
Results: We have developed a differential methylation analysis pack-
age (DMAP) to generate coverage-filtered reference methylomes and
to identify differentially methylated regions across multiple samples
from reduced representation bisulphite sequencing and whole
genome bisulphite sequencing experiments. We introduce a novel
fragment-based approach for investigating DNA methylation patterns
for reduced representation bisulphite sequencing data. Further, DMAP
provides the identity of gene and CpG features and distances to the
differentially methylated regions in a format that is easily analyzed with
limited bioinformatics knowledge.

Availability and implementation: The software has been imple-
mented in C and has been written to ensure portability between differ-
ent platforms. The source code and documentation is freely available
(DMAP: as compressed TAR archive folder) from http://biochem.otago.
ac.nz/research/databases-software/. Two test datasets are also avail-
able for download from the Web site. Test dataset 1 contains reads
from chromosome 1 of a patient and a control, which is used for com-
parative analysis in the current article. Test dataset 2 contains reads
from a part of chromosome 21 of three disease and three control sam-
ples for testing the operation of DMAP, especially for the analysis of
variance. Example commands for the analyses are included.

1 INTRODUCTION

DNA methylation is arguably the most stable epigenetic mark
that plays a key role in regulating development and disease
(Baylin and Bestor, 2002; Law and Jacobsen, 2010). One of the

most fundamental challenges for epigeneticists is to identify
DNA methylation differences between genomes. For instance,
differential methylation between diseased and normal samples,
interindividual variation within a population, differences be-
tween tissues or species and so on are of biological and clinical
relevance.

The rapid improvement in next-generation sequencing tech-
nologies now provides opportunities to interrogate DNA methy-
lation at single base resolution with high coverage across
multiple samples. Bisulphite treatment converts unmethylated
cytosines to uracils (and ultimately to thymine after amplifica-
tion), although leaving methylated cytosines unchanged.
Therefore, bisulphite treatment combined with next-generation
sequencing (BS-Seq) has become a preferred method to generate
base-resolution DNA methylation maps. Because whole-genome
bisulphite sequencing (WGBS) is still expensive and generates
challenging amounts of raw data, reduced representation bisul-
phite sequencing (RRBS) provides a cost-effective alternative for
whole-genome methylation sequencing. RRBS has been widely
used by several groups worldwide to interrogate functionally im-
portant genomic regions at high-sequencing coverage and sensi-
tivity (Baranzini er al., 2010; Bock e¢ al., 2011; Chatterjee et al.,
2012; Gertz et al., 2011; Gu et al., 2010; Smallwood et al., 2011;
Steine et al., 2011; Xi et al., 2012).

During the past few years, several alignment tools have been
developed to cope with asymmetric mapping issues of bisulphite
converted sequenced reads and to map millions of reads with
reasonable speed to the reference genome. Some of these aligners
are RMAP (Smith et a/., 2009), BS Seeker (Chen e¢ al., 2010),
Bismark (Krueger and Andrews, 2011), RRBSMAP (Xi et al.,
2012), BatMeth (Lim et a/., 2012) and PASS-bis (Campagna
et al., 2013). Recent comparative analyses have improved our
understanding of the efficiency, accuracy and algorithm of
these aligners (Chatterjee et a/., 2012; Kunde-Ramamoorthy
et al., 2014). Additionally, tools have been developed for gener-
ating methylation calls and visualization. Integrated Genome
Viewer (Thorvaldsdottir et a/., 2013) and MethVisual (Sun
et al., 2013) allow visualization of sequenced reads and regional
analysis. BiQ Analyzer HT allows site-specific DNA methylation
analysis (Schmieder and Edwards, 2011), and SAAP-RRBS can
perform alignment, methylation calls, annotation of CpG sites
and visualization (Ziller et a/., 2013).

methylKit (Akalin et a/., 2012a), an R package, enables detec-
tion of differentially methylated CpG sites (DMCs). methylKit

DMAP: differential methylation analysis package

applies a Fisher’s exact test or logistic regression to calculate
P-values that are adjusted to q-values for multiple test correction
using a SLIM approach (Wang e¢ al., 2011). For WGBS data,
BSmooth performs local averaging and sample-wise smoothing
of methylation values after alignment and methylation estimates
by read position (Hansen et a/., 2012). BSmooth applies numer-
ous CpG-wise t-tests, and based on a t-test threshold, differen-
tially methylated regions (DMRs) are defined. BiSeq, an R
package, performs smoothing of methylation data within CpG
clusters considering spatial dependence (Hebestreit et a/., 2013).
Differential methylation is then detected in CpG clusters, the
‘alse discovery rate is controlled and finally DMR boundaries
are defined.

In contrast to alignment and visualization tools, the number of
software packages available to detect DMRs is small. Some tools
offer detection of DMCs and some DMRs and most of them are
ardwired, i.e. they provide little flexibility in the choice of ana-
ysis parameters such as coverage criteria, DMR length and the
type of statistical test. Further, most available tools do not pro-
vide options for further analysis of DMRs with respect to its
genomic position such as the transcription start sites, genes,
CpG features and so on.

Here, we describe differential methylation analysis package
(DMAP), a pipeline that can directly import the output from
any bisulphite aligner in Sequence Alignment/Map (SAM)
format and identify differential methylation. We have primarily
designed the package to handle data from RRBS experiments
(which uses 40-220 bp MspI digested genomic fragments), but it
can be used effectively to investigate WGBS data for any eukary-
otic genome as well. A suite of statistical tests is included in
DMAP [Chi-square test, Fisher’s exact test and analysis of vari-
ance (ANOVA)] to identify methylation differences between dif-
ferent groups and conditions. For RRBS, we introduce a novel
approach of identifying differential methylation based on MspI
fragments [differentially methylated fragment (DMF)]. Further,
DMAP provides genomic relationship information (nearest gene,
exon, introns and CpG features) for each DMR or DMF.

2 METHODS AND ALGORITHMS

2.1. DMAP package and input data

DMAP contains two main programs. (i) diffmeth: The input files
to diffmeth are either SAM files from Bismark alignment
(Krueger and Andrews, 2011) or the older native format pro-
duced by the Bismark methylation_extractor program, compris-
ing a single line for each mapped CpG giving the chromosome,
the CpG position and the methylation status (+/—).
Alternatively, if other aligners (such as BSMAP and
RMAPBS) are used, then the files (BED file or text files) can
be processed by the rmapbscpg2 ancillary program before ana-
lysis with diffmeth. By default, diffmeth does not impose any
P-value cutoff for identifying DMR; it returns a P-value for
each investigated region/fragment to allow user-specified thresh-
old P-values and independent application of multiple test
corrections.

(ii) The final output file from diffmeth program can then be
used in the second main program of DMAP, identgeneloc, to
identify proximal genes and features (transcription start sites,

exons/introns, etc.), relationship to CpG features (CpG island
core/shore/shelf) and distances from each feature (Fig. 1). This
operation is performed by a command-line program, which reads
genomic feature table information and relates candidate regions
from the previous step to annotated features. The application
uses code originally developed in another context (Jacobs
et al., 2009) and is capable of parsing feature table information
from GenBank, EMBL, GTF, GFF3 and SeqMonk feature files,
although the latter has been extensively tested. If SeqMonk fea-
ture table information is used (-Q switch), then it is possible to
specify biotype for a gene (e.g. protein coding, pseudo-gene,
miRNA). Supplementary Information 2 and the program docu-

2.2 Units of DNA methylation analysis

2.2.1 DMC approach Differential methylation patterns can be
investigated in several ways. One of the approaches is to analyze
each CpG site (with adequate coverage) in each sample and then
to identify DMCs. DMAP permits the user to interrogate the
methylated (represented as + sign) and unmethylated (repre-
sented as — sign) counts for single CpG sites (e.g. Table 4) in
the datasets, but does not have options for detecting DMCs.
methylKit, an R package, uses a single CpG approach and pro-
vides options for detecting DMCs in RRBS and BS-Seq data
(Akalin e¢ al., 2012a). However, in WGBS or RRBS protocols,
millions of CpG sites are investigated (e.g. in humans, WGBS
covers ~30 million and RRBS covers ~4 million CpG sites). The
investigation of a large number of CpG sites greatly enhances the
false discovery rate. Variation at single sites is greater than that
of a contig of sites because the relatively lower coverage per site
increases the sampling variation (Ehrlich and Lacey, 2013). A
DMC approach is perhaps more useful when a small number
of CpG sites are analyzed.

2.2.2 DMR approach Use of a fixed or sliding window (typic-
ally 1000 bp length) as a unit of methylation analysis is another
common approach for detecting DMRs (Bock ef al., 2012; Li
et al., 2010). DMAP includes options for investigating differen-
tial methylation on a user-specified tiled window of any length.
Although the tiled DMR approach is well-suited for WGBS, for
RRBS, where only 2.5% of the genome is sequenced, the major-
ity of the windows will be empty or have partial inclusion of
fragments. Further, if a small region is variably/differentially
methylated between individuals, use of a 1000bp or longer
window might dilute this variation (Ehrlich and Lacey, 2013)
and therefore might be not be detected if large window size is
used.

2.3 Implementing MspI fragments as a unit of analysis for
RRBS (DMEF approach)

For RRBS, we introduced a new MspI fragment-based approach
for investigating DNA methylation. This approach is conceptu-
ally similar to the DMR approach, but instead of fixed-length
windows, MspI-digested fragments of 40-220 bp lengths were
used as the unit of analysis. After Bismark alignment, the methy-
lation_extractor program returns information for each mapped
CpG site, its genomic position and methylation status. diffmeth

scans the genomic sequence of each chromosome for MspI cleav-
age sites and CpGs, building a list of those conforming to the
required size range of 40-220 bp. For each sample, the methy-
lated and unmethylated CpGs are checked to find the fragment
on the list (if any) to which the CpG positions match and the
methylated and unmethylated counts are incremented. This in-
formation was used to calculate coverage (+ and — counts,
where + is a methylated CpG and — is an unmethylated CpG)
and quantify the methylation of each fragment. Then based on a
coverage cutoff (different cutoff criteria for filtering fragments
can be applied; see details in documentation), fragments with low
sequencing coverage were discarded, and a list of fragments and
their methylation status were produced for each sample.
Appropriate statistical tests and a P-value can then be applied
to identify DMFs. The sequenced reads in RRBS come from
MspI-digested fragments, and as one CpG site is included in
the recognition site (CCGG) of the enzyme, each fragment
will contain at least one valid analyzable CpG, irrespective of
the CpG density of the region. DMAP provides flexibility in the
choice of coverage criteria to include fragments from both CpG-
poor and CpG-rich regions (see documentation for setting cover-
age threshold).

While implementing the fragment-based approach, adjacent
MspI fragments posed a computational challenge. If two

Candidate fragments/regions

Proximal gene, TSS, exon, intron,
PG and features (and relative
distance from features)

fragments are adjacent, then the methylation counts of the
mapped reads, which start from the junctional MspI site, could
be counted in either of the fragments, as in the genome they share
the same location. However, for an accurate coverage calculation
for the fragments, the methylation counts from the CpG at the
junction of two adjacent fragments are attributed to the fragment
from which they were derived (see Supplementary Information 1,
section 7, for detailed demonstration of this behavior).

To ensure correct attribution of junctional CpG methylation,
we added a feature to DMAP that uses the data from the SAM
files (with the —N switch) to retain the identity of the strand onto
which a sequenced read is mapped. Then for the reverse strand-
mapped reads, the program identifies the fragment to which
these reads were mapped and accumulates the CpG information
for that fragment, including the first CpG site of the read but not
for the succeeding adjacent fragment. In the reference genome,
the last CpG site of an MspI fragment and the first CpG site of
the adjacent fragment are the same, but after this correction,
CpG information from the overlapping reads was counted
under the fragment from which the reads were derived.

Non-specific activity of the MspI enzyme and _ partially
degraded DNA could result in sequenced reads without a
MspI start site. For RRBS, 29% non-MspI sequenced reads
has been reported (Akalin er a/., 2012b). However, we observed

DMAP: differential methylation analysis package

a lower prevalence of non-MsplI reads in our test RRBS libraries
(median percentage of non-MspI reads = 8.1; = 11). Presence o!
non-MspI reads might affect unique alignment but does not in-
fluence DMAP. DMAP calculates methylated and unmethylate
counts for each CpG site in a fragment; therefore, a fragment wil
qualify for subsequent analysis if sufficient reads had uniquely
mapped to it, irrespective of the base composition of sequence
reads (i.e. MspI or non-MspI start of a read).

In a MspI-fragment, the CpG sites are likely to show more
similarities in terms of read coverage and DNA methylation
levels compared with the CpG sites in a large DMR. Further,
as a fragment is a contig of sites, it will decrease the sampling an
technical variation to a greater extent. Therefore, we believe the
fragment-based approach is the intermediate approach to DMR/
DMC approaches and perhaps better suited for RRBS data.

2.4 Statistical tests to identify DMF and DMR

The Fisher’s exact test over a sliding window with a specified fold
difference is a widely used approach for assessing differential
methylation between two samples or groups of samples (Bock
et al., 2010; Glastad er al., 2013; Gu et al., 2010; Ivanov et al.,
2013; Li et al., 2010). For RRBS data analysis, for a given MspI
fragment, Fisher’s exact tests can be performed between multiple
samples by giving a continuous list of SAM files in the command
in diffmeth tool of DMAP package. In this case, the probability
of multiple pairwise tests will be given and the lowest probability
taken to indicate the extent of differential methylation, although
this may obscure a number of insignificant differences between
other samples.

To investigate the extent of interindividual variability in DNA
methylation across multiple samples, we have used a Chi-squared
test. To perform this test, a list of SAM files should be provided
as an input to diffmeth. Various thresholds can be applied to
restrict the tests to fragments and samples that meet criteria
for CpG number, density of CpG mapping and fold difference.
For WGBS data, instead of fragments, tiled windows of defined
length can be investigated in a similar way. Output from this part
of DMAP consists of a line for each qualifying fragment or
region giving the chromosome number, region start and end pos-
itions, length, CpG count, coverage, the probability and the type
of statistic applied (Fig. 1 and Table 3).

Classifying subjects into treatment or disease versus control
groups is a usual task in DNA methylation analysis. To compare
methylation between two different groups, one strategy is to
concatenate the CpG position files or SAM files for each
group and perform a pairwise comparison. However, this
might lead to significant data loss while comparing multiple sam-
ples. A better strategy is implemented in DMAP using ANOVA
and the F ratio test to determine the significance of methylation
differences between the groups in relation to the residual vari-
ation within each group. ANOVA runs allow SAM files to be
assigned to either of two groups, generating an F (1, 7) value
where n depends on the number of qualifying individuals for
each region or fragment. The statistical significance of the F
statistic is estimated using a continued fraction iterative
method (Press ef al., 1993).

3 RESULTS AND OUTPUTS

3.1 Reference methylome

DMAP can produce reference methylomes for individual sam-
ples after filtering regions with a specified coverage criterion [for
example, reference methylomes can be based on MspI fragments
(for RRBS) or user-specified tiled windows]. Table 1 shows the
diffmeth output from a fragment-based methylome for a human
RRBS library generated from peripheral blood. A similar output
based on 1000 bp tiled windows is shown in Table 2 for a differ-
ent region of the same dataset. These outputs are produced as
text files, which can be easily subjected to further analysis.

3.2 Differential methylation analysis

While running differential methylation analysis, DMAP pro-
duces a list of analyzed regions showing corresponding P-
values and the details (such as name of the test, degrees of free-
dom if applicable) of the statistical test applied. By default,
DMAP does not impose any cutoff value to detect DMF or
DMR. Users can specify statistics and P-value cutoff to set a
threshold for calling DMF or DMR. This provides flexibility to
the users and options to apply multiple test corrections methods
(e.g. Bonferroni, false discovery rate or Holms methods) and set
stringent P-value cutoffs for detecting differential methylation.
Table 3 shows an example of candidate fragments after a test has
been performed on five human peripheral blood RRBS samples
for differential methylation analysis using the 7’ statistic. A simi-
lar analysis can be performed using tiled windows.

3.3 Single CpG investigation

DMAP does not allow detection of differential methylation at
single CpG sites; however, if investigation of each CpG is sought,
the diffmeth program of DMAP can produce + (methylated) and
— (unmethylated) counts for each CpG site within a fragment or
tiled window for each sample. Table 4 provides an example of
single CpG counts of an MspI fragment in chromosome 1, which
contained eight CpG sites for five RRBS samples as produced by
diffmeth. Alternatively, single CpG site differential methylation
can be performed using methylKit (Akalin e¢ a/., 2012a).

3.4 Gene and feature identification

The identgeneloc program of DMAP relates each DMF or DMR
(or any regions of interest from reference methylomes) to the
nearest gene by comparing the genomic coordinates of the
start and the end of the DMF or DMR with the coordinates
of the gene and gives relative distances from the transcription
start site. identgeneloc considers the sense of the gene (5’ or 3’)
and relates the DMF or DMR with respect to the upstream
region of the gene. The program includes options for users to
impose distance limits on how far valid genes can lie from the
fragment. identgeneloc can also provide CpG features (CpG
island, shore or core) for a DMF or DMR. Further, for a

region internal to a gene, an option is included to return infor-
mation on whether the fragment is located on an exon, intron or
spans over intron/exon or exon/intron boundaries. Table 5 pro-
vides an example of an identgeneloc output, showing candidate
DMFs, generated from a human RRBS library (annotation
source: SeqMonk feature table file). The output is a tab-
delimited text file.

Note: The identgenloc here provides data of chromosome, length of the region, number of CpG sites contained within the region, P-value, statistical test applied, distance in

relation to the gene (calculated from the start of the gene), relationship with the gene (e.g. upstream, exon, intron), CpG feature relation, strand and the name of the

associated

gene. The — in the gene distance column indicates the region is inside the gene body. The output is a tab-delimited text file, suitable for importing into Microsoft Excel. Gene

distance is calculated from the start of the gene.

Test dataset 1 contains two SAM files with uniquely aligned
reads for chromosome | from a control (2851855 reads) and a
disease sample (1 122068 reads). A pairwise test was performed
on CpG sites or regions common between both samples. DMAP
completed the differential methylation analysis in <3.1 min,
which was >5 times faster than methylKit and >10 times faster
than BiSeq (Table 6). The main reason for the faster operation of
DMAP is that after the alignment—using the SAM files—it is
possible to filter fragments (or tiled windows) by coverage, set
fold methylation difference criteria and perform a statistical test
in one step with a single command. Further, because DMAP is
written in C it runs as compiled machine code, and therefore, it
executes efficiently. After differential methylation analysis, a
second operation of DMAP (performed by identgeneloc) pro-
duces gene and CpG feature of the candidate regions. identgen-
eloc took 1.2min to complete the second operation for 9362
investigated fragments in chromosome | between the disease
and control from test dataset 1.

Analysis by methylKit (version 0.5.7) resulted in 935 DMCs
(filtered by CpG coverage of >10, DESTRAND=TRUE,
q-value of <0.01 and percent methylation difference >25%).
BiSeq (version 1.2.4) investigated 165378 clusters and resulted
in 402 DMR entries (criteria of analysis was min.sites = 20,
quantile (totalReads (rrbs.clust.unlim) [ind.cov],0.9, minDiff=
0.25, max.dist = 100). Of the BiSeq DMRs, 131 of them were
single CpGs. The other 271 regions varied in length; the
median length of the DMRs was 18.5 bp and the largest DMR
781 bp. Using the same dataset, DMAP was used to investigate
9362 common fragments (coverage filter: >2 CpGs in a fragment
having coverage of > 10; the F2 t10 switch in DMAP) containing
78 318 CpG sites. DMAP identified 367 significant DMFs (basic
cutoff=0.05, adjusted P-value cutoff=5.34x 10~° after
Bonferroni correction). The 367 DMFs contained 3215 CpG
sites (Table 6).

When we compared the co-ordinates of the DMCs derived
from methylKit, we found that 318 of 935 DMCs from
methylKit overlapped with the CpGs contained within the 367
DMFs identified by DMAP. Similarly, 190 DMCs from

methylKit overlapped with CpGs within the 402 DMRs identi-
fied by BiSeq. Also, 439 of 1827 CpG sites in BiSeq-identified
DMRs overlapped with 3215 CpG sites in the DMAP-identified
DMFs. Overall, 157 CpG sites were identified by all three tools.
To investigate if the tools performed better in identifying any
particular regions of the genome compared with the others, we
mapped the genomic locations of DMCs, DMFs and DMRs
identified by methylKit, DMAP and BiSeq respectively
(Fig. 2). Using SeqMonk feature table information (based on
Ensembl annotation), each region was related to its nearest pro-
tein coding gene and distances from the start of the gene was
calculated. DMAP identified higher proportion of promoter
associated regions and lower intronic regions compared to
methylKit and BiSeq. However, methylKit identified a higher
proportion of CpG sites that were Skb or further apart from
the transcription start site (TSS>5 kb) compared to the regions
identified by DMAP and BiSeq. All three tools identified similar
levels of exonic differential methylation. Further, BiSeq and
DMAP identified similar proportion of exon-intron junction
DMRs. Exon-intron junction identification is not possible with
methylKit as it identifies DMCs. The CpGs that were common
between all the three tools were more prevalent in far upstream
of the genes (TSS>5kb) and relatively lower in the promoter
and introns.

4 DISCUSSION

A higher number of DMCs is expected compared to the number
of DMFs/DMRs, because each DMF/DMR will contain several
differentially methylated CpGs. DMF/DMR will also contain
CpG sites that individually will not qualify as differentially
methylated. Further, there will be several independent DMCs
that will not form part of a DMF or DMR. This explains the
finding of higher DMCs identified by methylKit and lower
DMR/DMFs identified by BiSeq and DMAP. A frame-to-
frame comparison of differential methylation patterns between
these tools is not possible because each of them uses a different
unit of analysis to determine differential methylation. The

fragment-based approach is specific to DMAP whereas
methylKit detects DMCs and BiSeq detects DMRs of variable
length. Each program uses different statistical tests (see Table 7),
different parameters for defining the unit of DNA methylation
analysis (i.e., DMR boundaries or DMCs), and different criteria
for including CpGs based on coverage. methylKit and DMAP
investigate differential methylation in the 4 million CpG sites or
647626 MspI fragments (in a 40-220 bp human RRBS genome),
respectively. However, BiSeq considers the spatial arrangement
of CpG sites in the genome and defines CpG clusters by specify-
ing a number of frequently covered CpG sites (option: min.sites)
that are close to each other (option: max.dist) and uses these

clusters for subsequent analysis. Imposing flexible criteria for
defining CpG clusters (i.e., lowering min.sites value) in analysis
would result in higher number analyzable CpG clusters and
higher number of DMRs but might enhance the chances of
false discovery. Further, for this analysis we did not specify
any DMR cut-off length in BiSeq. Therefore DMCs were also
detected in BiSeq as we wanted to include all the possible regions
for a fair comparison with methylKit. During the review process,
we found that BiSeq version 1.2.0 and 1.2.3 contained an erro-
neous readBismark function, which produced a very high
number of DMRs for our analysis (as a result of false methyla-
tion calls), the function was corrected in version 1.2.4. Therefore,

it is advisable to use several tools in combination to ensure detec-

biological interpretation.
In terms of coverage, methylKit called the CpG sites with 10
or more reads from the aligned SAM files. In DMAP, fragments
aving two CpG sites with 10 or more reads were included for
analysis. In contrast, BiSeq uses a quantile approach for smooth-
ing methylation data where a higher weighting is given to CpG
sites with high coverage and sites with an unusually high cover-
age are excluded (for example, to the 90% quantile in this ana-
ysis). These differences could account for some of the variation
observed in the comparative differential methylation analysis
performed here.
We present DMAP, an analysis package that filters and pro-
cesses aligned bisulphite sequenced data to generate comprehen-
sive reference methylomes (tile based and fragment based) with
exibility for users. From SAM files, DMAP provides statistically
significant DMRs and relates them to genes and CpGs. Statistical
approaches for the analysis of genome-wide methylation data are
not yet well characterized. A caveat to the use of statistical tests for
ragment or window-based approaches is that methylation values
or CpGs within a sequenced read are likely to be correlated, and
thus statistical significance can be overestimated. Therefore, fur-
ther work is needed to devise better statistical methods for accur-
ate detection of differential methylation.
Aside from some awk scripts, DMAP is written in C and exe-
cutes efficiently. In our test runs, the diffmeth program was able to
produce a list of candidate regions (while processing 11 human
RRBS samples) in 4h. The output from this step was processed in
20 min by identgeneloc to produce gene features of the candidate
regions. Although the package was initially developed for the
human genome, the code was modified to work with any eukary-
otic genome. Optionally, DMAP has no expectation of an X and

Y chromosome and can work with any number of autosomal
chromosomes. We tested the package with zebrafish genome
(Zv9 assembly), which has 25 chromosomes (and no X and Y
chromosome), and all the features described in this article
worked successfully (Chatterjee et al., 2013). To our knowledge,
DMAP is the first tool that accepts unsorted raw SAM alignment
files as an input, detects DMR or DMF, provides information and
distances of nearest genes and CpG features in relation to each
DMF or DMR. The outputs (exported to text files) are relatively
easy for bench scientists without bioinformatics expertise to ana-
lyze and use with other tools.

Genetic risk factors for severe and fatigue ="

dominant long COVID and commonalities
with ME/CFS identified by combinatorial
analysis

Abstract

Background Long COVID is a debilitating chronic condition that has affected over 100 million people globally. It

is characterized by a diverse array of symptoms, including fatigue, cognitive dysfunction and respiratory problems.
Studies have so far largely failed to identify genetic associations, the mechanisms behind the disease, or any com-
mon pathophysiology with other conditions such as myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS)
that present with similar symptoms.

Methods We used a combinatorial analysis approach to identify combinations of genetic variants significantly associ-
ated with the development of long COVID and to examine the biological mechanisms underpinning its various symp-
toms. We compared two subpopulations of long COVID patients from Sano Genetics’ Long COVID GOLD study cohort,
focusing on patients with severe or fatigue dominant phenotypes. We evaluated the genetic signatures previously
identified in an ME/CFS population against this long COVID population to understand similarities with other fatigue
disorders that may be triggered by a prior viral infection. Finally, we also compared the output of this long COVID
analysis against known genetic associations in other chronic diseases, including a range of metabolic and neurologi-
cal disorders, to understand the overlap of pathophysiological mechanisms.

Results Combinatorial analysis identified 73 genes that were highly associated with at least one of the long COVID
populations included in this analysis. Of these, 9 genes have prior associations with acute COVID-19, and 14 were
differentially expressed in a transcriptomic analysis of long COVID patients. A pathway enrichment analysis revealed
that the biological pathways most significantly associated with the 73 long COVID genes were mainly aligned

with neurological and cardiometabolic diseases.

Expanded genotype analysis suggests that specific SNX9 genotypes are a significant contributor to the risk of or pro-
tection against severe long COVID infection, but that the gene-disease relationship is context dependent and medi-
ated by interactions with KLF75 and RYR3.

Comparison of the genes uniquely associated with the Severe and Fatigue Dominant long COVID patients revealed
significant differences between the pathways enriched in each subgroup. The genes unique to Severe long COVID
patients were associated with immune pathways such as myeloid differentiation and macrophage foam cells. Genes

unique to the Fatigue Dominant subgroup were enriched in metabolic pathways such as MAPK/JNK signaling. We
also identified overlap in the genes associated with Fatigue Dominant long COVID and ME/CFS, including several
involved in circadian rhythm regulation and insulin regulation. Overall, 39 SNPs associated in this study with long
COVID can be linked to 9 genes identified in a recent combinatorial analysis of ME/CFS patient from UK Biobank.

Among the 73 genes associated with long COVID, 42 are potentially tractable for novel drug discovery approaches,
with 13 of these already targeted by drugs in clinical development pipelines. From this analysis for example, we identi-
fied TLR4 antagonists as repurposing candidates with potential to protect against long term cognitive impairment
pathology caused by SARS-CoV-2. We are currently evaluating the repurposing potential of these drug targets for use

Conclusion This study demonstrates the power of combinatorial analytics for stratifying heterogeneous populations
in complex diseases that do not have simple monogenic etiologies. These results build upon the genetic findings
from combinatorial analyses of severe acute COVID-19 patients and an ME/CFS population and we expect that access
to additional independent, larger patient datasets will further improve the disease insights and validate potential

Introduction

Post COVID-19 condition (or long COVID) is a debili-
tating syndrome that the World Health Organization
(WHO) estimates affects up to 20% of people infected
by SARS-CoV-2 [1]. Other more recent studies put
the prevalence of long-term symptoms (over 3 months
post-infection) in COVID-19 patients even higher
(2], with all estimates implying that over 100 million
patients have been affected by the condition globally
[3]. Even though symptoms decline for most patients
over time, some patients still experienced symptoms
such as post-exertional malaise or postural tachycardia
syndrome (POTS) [4] up to 2 years after infection [5],
and the long-term health consequences of long COVID
remain unknown, with suggestions of a doubling of the
risk of developing cardiovascular issues [6].

Reports indicate an extensive array of symptoms
associated with long COVID [7], with the most com-
mon being fatigue and post-exertional malaise (PEM)
[8], cognitive dysfunction [9], mood disturbances [10]
and respiratory problems [11]. However, establishing a
precise diagnosis for either of these diseases has proved
challenging, in large part due to the complexity and
diversity of their clinical presentation and their effects
across multiple organ systems. In an attempt to pro-
vide some definitive metrics, a recent study developed
a data-driven scoring framework for diagnosing long
COVID based on the available symptom data [12].

Although many studies have investigated the genetic
risks underlying long COVID, only one genome-wide
association study (GWAS) has identified a single risk

locus around the lead variant in FOXP4 [13, 14]. Stud-
ies that used combinatorial analytical approaches to
delineate genetic risk factors in similarly heterogenous
populations have demonstrated more success, for
example in severe COVID-19 [15] and ME/CFS [16].

Combinatorial analytics approaches identify combi-
nations of features that together (rather than individu-
ally) are associated with the disease phenotype [17].
They capture the non-linear effects of interactions
between multiple genes (and exogenous factors if avail-
able). These signals are distinct from and complemen-
tary to the monogenic, linear additive associations of
single SNPs found by GWAS. In complex (multifacto-
rial and heterogenous) diseases these non-linear com-
binatorial signals are significantly more important in
understanding disease biology than in relatively mono-
genic disorders such as many cancers and rare genetic
disorders [18, 19].

In this study we used combinatorial analytics to iden-
tify disease risk signatures (combinations of genetic
variants significantly associated with the development
of long COVID) and explored the biological mecha-
nisms with which they are involved. We investigated
subpopulations of long COVID patients who had expe-
rienced either severe disease or a fatigue dominant
phenotype, to compare the underlying genes and path-
ways that explain some of the heterogenous manifesta-
tions of the disease.

We also compared the output of this study against our
previous ME/CFS analysis [16] to understand similarities
in post-viral fatigue and other phenotypes experienced

by subsets of long COVID patients. Finally, we compared
the pathways that were significantly enriched in this
genetic analysis of long COVID against known genetic
associations in other chronic diseases that are predomi-
nantly autoimmune, neurological and/or metabolic in
nature, to evaluate any common _pathophysiological
mechanisms that might be shared by long COVID.

Methods

Sano Genetics GOLD study dataset

Genotypic and phenotypic data for both cases and con-
trols included in this study were generated from Sano
Genetics’ Long COVID GOLD study [20]. Eligible par-
ticipants (n=1996), recruited between 2020 and 2022,
provided saliva samples for an at-home Sano DNA Test
(evaluated via Illumina Global Screening Array with
Multi-disease drop-in panel) and completed a ques-
tionnaire hosted on the Sano Genetics platform detail-
ing their acute COVID-19 and long COVID symptoms

(if experienced), as well as basic demographic data and
other chronic health conditions (see Additional file 1).

Symptom based score for long COVID severity

Given the heterogeneity of post-COVID symptoms
reported by the GOLD study and other previous stud-
ies, we developed a data-driven scoring method to char-
acterize the severity of self-reported symptoms. We
analyzed participant reported scores for each available
long COVID symptom experienced pre- and post-acute
COVID-19, including breathlessness, fatigue, degree
of muscle pain and change in mental health (see Addi-
tional file 5: Table S1 for more details). A “Total Change’
score was generated for each patient from the sum of
the reported differences across symptoms pre- and
post-COVID.

Cohort characteristics

At the time of analysis, a total of 1829 individuals in
the GOLD study had a self-reported COVID-19 diag-
nosis. This COVID-19 cohort had a median age of
50 years [interquartile range (IQR) =40—60] and median
COVID-19 recovery time of 169 days [IQR=14—507.5]
(Table 1). It consisted of 61.1% females and 92.6% self-
reported their ethnicity as ‘White! The most prevalent
self-reported comorbidities (prior to or after COVID-
19) in the cohort were anxiety or panic attacks (30.0%),
depression (26.2%), asthma (25.5%), eczema (18.6%) and
migraines (17.4%).

The GOLD study cohort included in this analysis was
recruited between January 2020 and November 2022.
Using the Office for National Statistics (ONS) COVID-
19 Infection Survey data [21], we have estimated the
most prevalent circulating SARS-CoV-2 variant in the
UK that each participant was most likely to be exposed
to when they contracted COVID-19 (Fig. 1). This dem-
onstrates that the majority (65%) of samples included
in the study were most likely infected with the wildtype
strain. The study does not include any participants who
contracted any of the more recent SARS-CoV-2 variants
that emerged in 2023.

Of those confirmed to have had COVID-19, 1345
(73.5%) reported fatigue symptoms, 1135 (62.1%)
reported symptoms linked to concentration, 1124 (61.5%)
reported short-term memory symptoms and 714 (39.0%)
reported breathlessness. The median ‘Total Change’

Page 4 of 23

symptom score for the cohort was 15 [IQR=2—35]
(Additional file 5: Figure S1).

In the dataset, 1489 (81.4%) individuals provided free-
text responses on other symptoms that they experienced
since their illness that were not covered elsewhere in the
questionnaire. The most frequently reported symptoms
included loss of smell, headache, pain, tinnitus, loss of
taste, dizziness, insomnia and postural tachycardia syn-
drome (POTS) (see Additional file 5: Table S2 and Addi-
tional file 5: Figure $2). Following COVID infection, 353
(19.3%) individuals reported reducing their working
hours while 359 (19.6%) people discontinued working
altogether post-illness.

Long COVID cohorts

We defined two long COVID case populations from the
GOLD study based on self-reported symptom changes
3 months post COVID-19—‘Severe’ long-haulers who
reported the greatest variety and severity of symptoms
and ‘Fatigue Dominant’ cases who reported predomi-
nantly fatigue-associated long COVID symptoms.

The World Health Organization defines long COVID
patients as those experiencing one or more symptoms
post initial COVID-19 infection. However, the cohort in
the GOLD study that met these criteria displayed a great
range in the severity and length of self-reported symp-
toms experienced post COVID-19. Instead, we aimed

to focus on the more ‘severe’ long haulers who reported
the greatest degree of symptoms experienced as these are
likely to be the patients experiencing long COVID symp-
toms that do not diminish over time without pharmaceu-
tical intervention.

The Fatigue Dominant’ cohort was chosen primarily
due to their phenotypic similarity with ME/CFS, allowing
us to explore potential commonalities between the dis-
eases based on our previously published combinatorial
analysis for ME/CFS [16].

The number and overlap in cases and controls included
in the two datasets are included in Additional file 5: Fig-
ure $3.

Severe long COVID cohort

The Severe long COVID cohort (n=1,323 where
cases =459 and controls = 864) was selected using the dif-
ference in scores reported pre- and post-acute COVID-
19 for three long COVID symptom groups—namely,
respiratory, fatigue and mental health. Severe cases were
defined as those with a ‘Total Change’ score for these
symptoms greater than or equal to the upper quartile of
the distribution. The controls in this study were defined
as samples with a “Total Change’ score greater than or
equal to 0 but below the median of the distribution.

Fatigue dominant long COVID cohort

The Fatigue Dominant cohort (n=1,386 where
cases=477 and controls=909) was selected using only
a subset of symptoms relating to fatigue in the scores

COVID-19 symptoms (see Additional file 5: Table S1).

The controls in this study were defined as samples with
a ‘Fatigue Change’ score greater than or equal to 0 but
below the median of the distribution.

The characteristics of the two cohorts are shown in
Fig. 2 and described in Table 1, Fig. 1, Fig. 2 and Addi-
tional file 5: Figure S4.

Dataset QC

The two case-control datasets underwent a series of
quality control (QC) procedures before they were ana-
lyzed using the PrecisionLife platform.

Standard variant-level and sample-level QC procedures
were applied to the dataset (comprising of 696,382 SNPs)
as described in the Genotype Quality Control section
in Supplementary Information. Due to the small sample
size of the two long COVID cohorts, the genotype data
was filtered to exclude SNPs with minor allele frequency
(MAF) <5%. Very low frequency SNPs were removed as
significant combinations involving rare variants are espe-
cially infrequent. This filter also increases the statistical
power of combinatorial analysis to detect genotype-dis-
ease associations by reducing the amount of false discov-
ery rate (FDR) correction required when testing multiple
SNP-genotype combinations. Following QC, the Severe
dataset comprised of 283,478 SNPs and the Fatigue Dom-
inant dataset contained 283,444 SNPs.

may include multiple SNP genotypes and/or other multi-
modal features in combination. These disease signatures
capture both the linear and non-linear effects of genetic
and molecular interaction networks and enable the iden-
tification of associations including those that are only
relevant to a subgroup of patients. We have previously
validated this analytical approach across a variety of com-
plex chronic diseases where it has identified more asso-
ciations with increased explanation of observed disease
variance and reproducibility than comparable GWAS
studies [15-17].

In the combinatorial analytics approach, disease signa-
tures are identified and statistically validated in ‘layers’
of increasing combinatorial complexity, i.e., singletons,
pairs, triplets etc. (also known as combinatorial order).
Each disease signature is validated multiple times using
several statistical tests at each stage of the process to
avoid false positives. A more detailed description of the
mining and validation stages is given in our previous ME/
CFS study [16].

We applied the PrecisionLife platform to both long
COVID case-control datasets in a hypothesis-free man-
ner to identify combinations of SNP genotypes that are
strongly associated with the development of long COVID
symptoms when they co-occur in the same patient. The
method prioritizes SNP genotype combinations that have
high odds ratios, low p-values (p< 0.05) and high preva-
lence (>5%) in long COVID cases. A permutation-based
approach was used to compare the observed properties
of the most highly associated SNP-genotype combina-
tions to the null distribution for randomized datasets
[22], with p-value cut-offs based on a specified threshold
(Benjamini—Hochberg FDR of 0.05) after multiple test-
ing correction. Combinations passing these tests were
reported as validated long COVID disease signatures.

Finally, a merged network (disease architecture) view is
generated by clustering all validated disease signatures
based on their co-occurrence in patients in the dataset.

SNPs found in multiple disease signatures often form
the central hub of the disease architecture (see Fig. 3).
These are termed ‘critical SNPs’ if the corresponding net-
works pass a further permutation-based statistical test.
Potential critical SNPs are scored using a Random For-
est (RF) algorithm with a fivefold cross-validation frame-
work to assess the accuracy with which they predict the
case-control split in the dataset.

A cascade mapping process was used to map all the
critical SNPs identified in the validated disease signa-
tures to the human reference genome (GRCh38) [23].
SNPs identified in the coding region of a gene (or genes)
were mapped directly to this gene and any remaining
SNPs within 2kb upstream or 0.5kb downstream were
mapped to the nearest gene(s). Due to the uncertainty
about the wide range of cells and tissues that have been
implicated in long COVID etiology [7], genes assigned
by either expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) or
chromatin interaction (Hi-C) data were not specifically
prioritized for further analysis (as they would likely be in
other indications) to avoid capturing any spurious associ-
ations from non-trait-related tissues or cells. Genes that
could additionally be mapped using only eQTL or Hi-C
data from the critical SNPs were observed and reported
in Additional file 2, although these were not further
evaluated.

Finally, a semantic knowledge graph, including data
from over 50 public data sources (see Additional file 5:
Table S3), was used to annotate the SNPs and genes,
including data on prior genetic associations to disease,
chromosomal location, tissue expression profiles, splice
variants, mouse phenotypes, protein function/structure,

known active chemistry and any pre-existing scientific
literature or clinical trials among other attributes. This
allows us to generate evidence-backed mechanism of
action hypotheses as to each genetic variant’s potential
impact on a patient’s long COVID phenotype.

Ancestry analysis

Ancestry inference for the samples in the GOLD study
was performed using GRAF-pop [24]. To maximize the
number of samples included in each case-control data-
set, samples of all ancestries were included in the analysis.
Since ancestry-specific analyses could not be performed
due to limited samples in each cohort, we performed a
logistic regression analysis to control for confounding
effects of population structure. Any disease signatures
that were no longer significantly associated with case—
control status (»<0.05 with Bonferroni FDR correction)
in a logistic regression that also includes a binary ances-
try variable for white-European/other ancestry were con-
sidered false positives and removed from further analysis.

Assessing causality with expanded genotypes analysis
The disease signatures output by the PrecisionLife plat-
form represent combinations of SNP genotypes that

for a disease signature comprised of two SNPs. After controlling

for the confounding effects of the interacting SNP genotype, patients

and “2") have consistently elevated odds of disease relative to patients
with the wild type genotype ("0") at the critical SNP

Page 7 of 23

are significantly enriched in cases relative to controls.
Expanded genotypes analysis (“EGA”) tests how the gen-
otype of a critical SNP from the disease signature affects
the odds of disease when the genotypes of all interacting
SNPs are held constant.

For each disease signature, we first assign patients to
one of the possible combinations of the component SNP
genotypes (the “expanded genotype signatures”). In the
example illustrated in Fig. 4, the validated disease signa-
ture is comprised of two SNPs, each in one of 3 states (0,
1 and 2), which can generate 9 (3”) expanded genotype
signatures. For combinations of 3, 4, and 5 SNPs, the
number of expanded genotypes signatures is 27, 81, and
243 respectively. We then calculate the disease odds for
patients with each expanded genotype signature.

For a given critical SNP of interest, we identify sets of
expanded genotype signatures that share the same geno-
types for all interacting SNPs (the blocks separated by the
horizontal lines in Fig. 4). We calculate the “EGA odds
ratio” by dividing the disease odds ratio for an expanded
genotype signature with a copy of the critical SNP minor
allele by the disease odds ratio for the matching expanded
genotype signature with the critical SNP homozygous
wild type genotype.

Due to the small number of patients associated with
individual expanded genotype signatures, we may have
insufficient statistical power to directly test whether the
EGA odds ratios are significantly different from zero.
Instead, the primary aim of the EGA is to test whether
the observed directionality of the relationship between
the critical SNP minor allele and disease phenotype is
consistent across all or most expanded genotype signa-
tures. If the critical SNP genotype does not affect disease,
then we expect the minor allele genotype will be ran-
domly associated with increased odds of disease for some
expanded genotype signatures and decreased odds of dis-
ease for others, with no consistent biological pattern.

In the hypothetical example shown in Fig. 4, the EGA
reveals that the critical SNP minor allele is consistently
associated with elevated disease risk after controlling for
the genotype of the interacting SNP. This pattern holds
even though patients with the critical SNP minor allele
have below average odds of disease when they also pos-
sess the wild type genotype at the interacting SNP. By
controlling for the confounding effects of the interacting
SNP, EGA allows us to gain a better understanding of the
relationship between the critical SNP and disease.

Each disease signature was assigned to one of the fol-
lowing seven categories based on the broad patterns
observed from the EGA: universally causative, univer-
sally protective, SNP-specific causative, SNP-specific
protective, combination-specific causative, combination-
specific protective, or ambiguous. Definitions of each

--- Page 8 ---
Taylor et al. Journal of Translational Medicine (2023) 21:775

category are provided in Additional file 5: Table S5.
Across these categories, the designation of “Causative”
and “Protective” do not necessarily guarantee that the
specific critical SNP identified in the analysis directly
affects disease risk. Due to low SNP coverage, the criti-
cal SNP could potentially be a neutral marker that is in
strong linkage disequilibrium with the true biological
variant.

We excluded all expanded genotype signatures which
occurred in fewer than 15 patients from the EGA. Like-
wise, we did not consider disease signatures comprised
of 4 or 5 SNPs due to the limited statistical power pro-
vided by the size of the available datasets. There are 81
possible expanded genotype signatures for a combina-
tion of 4 SNPs, which corresponds to only 17 patients
per expanded genotype signature. More problematically,
there are 243 possible expanded genotype signatures for
a combination of 5 SNPs, which corresponds to fewer
than 6 patients per expanded genotype signature. The
stochastic noise associated with such small sample sizes
make it very difficult to identify broad patterns across the
full set of expanded genotype pairs.

Phenotype enrichment analysis

The available clinical data from the questionnaire was
used to evaluate the long COVID patient profiles associ-
ated with each of the disease signatures generated by the
analysis. We calculated the statistical significance of the
association of a particular phenotype with a set of long
COVID cases with shared genetic variants when com-
pared against the rest of the case population. The two
proportions Z-test was used for categorical variables,
such as severity of acute COVID-19 and comorbidities,
and Mann-Whitney U [25] for any continuous variables,
such as participant reported scores that reflect change
in symptoms pre- and post-COVID-19. Statistical asso-
ciations were corrected for multiple testing using Benja-
mini—Hochberg method.

Overlap analysis (“seeded” approach)
We evaluated the genetic overlap between the Severe and
Fatigue Dominant cohorts by taking the SNPs identi-
fied in the hypothesis-free analysis for one dataset (seed
SNPs) and testing whether any combinations involving
them are also significantly associated with disease risk in
the second dataset when analyzed by the PrecisionLife
platform (see section “Combinatorial analytics using the
PrecisionLife platform”).

This hypothesis-driven or ‘seeded’ approach was per-
formed in addition to a direct gene overlap analysis
between the two cohorts. This approach mitigates the

Page 8 of 23

effects of stochastic differences in dataset composition
when defining the combinatorial search space explored
in our analyses. The number of possible SNP-genotype
combinations is so extensive that it is impossible to sam-
ple the entirety of the space. This implies that true asso-
ciations may remain unreported because they were not
tested when the dataset was analyzed using the hypoth-
esis-free approach.

We also employed this technique when evaluating the
overlap between the genes identified in our analysis of
the UK Biobank ME/CFS population and the two long
COVID cohorts generated from the GOLD study. Due
to the low SNP overlap (1=42,500) between the arrays
used to genotype the ME/CFS and long COVID datasets,
we performed a seeded analysis using 383 SNPs in the
Severe and Fatigue GOLD dataset that were within 10kb
up or downstream of the original 14 ME/CFS genes.

Cross disease analysis

Cross disease analysis can provide insights into potential
drug repurposing opportunities or development of com-
mon therapies. We compared the genes that were sig-
nificantly associated with Severe and Fatigue Dominant
long COVID against a variety of other chronic diseases
to identify shared pathophysiological mechanisms. These
diseases included neurodegenerative, mental and behav-
ioural disorders, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, auto-
immune and metabolic diseases (see Additional file 5:
Tables S8, S9). Disease-associated genes identified for
each indication group are those with known genetic links
reported in OpenTargets [26] (v 23.02, February 2023
release). Only genes with strong target-disease genetic
association scores (>0.9 out of 1.0) have been used in this
analysis for each indication group.

Enrichment analysis was performed using the g:Profiler
tool [27] to determine pathways and biological processes
that are significantly associated with the disease-asso-
ciated genes for each indication group (p<0.05, p-value
correction for multiple testing using Benjamini-Hoch-
berg). This allows us to explore up/downstream of indi-
vidual gene targets to identify biological processes that
are impacted across diseases.

Results

GWAS analysis

We evaluated the significance of individual genetic
variants associated with the two long COVID datasets
(Severe and Fatigue Dominant) using a standard GWAS
analysis with PLINK [28]. As can be observed from the
two Manhattan plots (Additional file 5: Figure S5), no
SNP from either of the two cohorts reached the genome-
wide significance threshold (p< 5x 10~°).

COVID GOLD study (2020-2022)

Cohort analysis
To determine whether there was a correlation between
circulation SARS-CoV-2 variant and long COVID symp-
tom severity, we plotted the “Total Change’ score for all
study participants, including cases and controls, against
the month they first contracted COVID-19 (Fig. 5). As
defined in our Severe long COVID cohort, the greater the
‘Total Change’ score, the greater the degree of severity in
long COVID symptoms experienced by the participant.
This analysis shows a significant decrease in symptom
severity over time, although the correlation coefficient is
low, potentially due to data variability (Additional file 5:
Figure S6).

Hypothesis free combinatorial analysis

Using the PrecisionLife combinatorial analysis platform,
we identified 86 disease associated critical SNPs for the
Severe cohort and 84 for the Fatigue Dominant cohort,
mapping to 43 and 36 genes respectively (Table 2). A
total of 74 unique genes were associated with at least
one of the long COVID cohorts, including 5 genes which
were identified in both the Severe and Fatigue Dominant
cohorts.

The disease signatures associated with each cohort
were all combinations of 2 or more SNP genotypes,
ie., they were all combinatorial signals, predominantly
involving combinations of 3-5 SNPs, that could not have
been identified using GWAS (Fig. 6). An example of one
of the disease signatures identified in the analysis of the
Severe long COVID cohort is shown in Table 3. None of

Taylor et al. Journal of Translational Medicine (2023) 21:775

in the Fatigue Dominant cohort comprised of SNPs that
could be mapped to genes with shared biological func-
tions or pathways (see Additional file 3).

As there were limited number of cases and controls of
non-European ancestry (see Additional file 5: Table S6)
in each of the two datasets, we evaluated the output to
identify any disease signatures that may be confounded
by population structure effects rather than reflecting a
true disease signal.

All disease signatures in the Severe cohort passed the
ancestry confounder analysis. We identified 129 (9%)
disease signatures in the Fatigue Dominant cohorts that
did not pass the ancestry confounder check (Additional
file 5: Table S7). However, when we removed the SNPs
and mapped genes represented only by these poten-
tially confounding disease signatures (and not also by
one or more additional true disease signatures), only
one gene (AC005005.1) associated with the Fatigue
Dominant cohort linked to the critical SNP, rs4820946,
was eliminated from all final disease associated gene
lists. This reduced the 74 genes found to 73.

The cohort analysis indicates that fewer than 15%
of cases that were assigned to either one or both long
COVID case groups were hospitalized with severe
COVID-19 or reported co-associated chronic diseases
such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease or cognitive
impairment. This meant that the number of cases with
these phenotypes was too low to identify any associa-
tions, such as COVID-19 severity or a particular comor-
bidity, with genetic disease signatures.

Page 11 of 23

Enrichment analysis of the fatigue, respiratory and
mental health symptom-based scores for the Severe
long COVID patients was used to investigate the clinical
characteristics of the disease signatures identified in the
Severe cohort study. Unfortunately, the population sizes
were too small to reach statistical significance (p< 0.05)
after multiple-testing correction (see Additional file 4).

From the two independent hypothesis-free analyses of
the datasets, we identified SNP genotypes mapping to 5
genes that were found to be significantly associated with
disease in both the Severe and Fatigue Dominant long
COVID cohorts. For each gene, more than 70% of cases
from both cohorts possessed at least one disease signa-
ture containing an associated SNP (Table 4). These genes
have a range of different functions and potential mecha-
nism of action hypotheses as to their role in the develop-
ment of long COVID.

Seeded analysis to test overlap between long Covid
cohorts
The two independent analyses of the Fatigue Dominant
and Severe cohorts indicated that 5 genes were strongly
associated with long COVID in both cohorts. We per-
formed two seeded analyses to understand if any addi-
tional genes identified in either the Fatigue or Severe
cohorts were also significant in the other population.
This approach revealed that 28/43 genes identified in
the Severe cohort were also significantly associated with
disease in the Fatigue Dominant cohort, and 25/35 genes
from the original Fatigue Dominant analysis were also
associated in the Severe cohort. This left 15 genes unique

A comparative pathway enrichment analysis using the
g:Profiler tool revealed that there were significant differ-
ences in the biological pathways associated with the lists
of unique genes from the Severe and Fatigue Dominant
cohorts (Fig. 8). Genes that were uniquely associated
with the Severe long COVID cohort were more likely
to be found in immune pathways such as myeloid dif-
ferentiation, macrophage foam cells and lipid signaling
pathways. Genes that were uniquely associated with the
Fatigue Dominant cohort were linked to metabolic path-
ways such as JNK/MAPK signaling cascades.

Comparison of long COVID with ME/CFS

We also used the seeded analysis approach to test for
overlap between disease signatures associated with long
COVID and those associated with ME/CFS in our previ-
ous study [16].

Taking the list of SNPs within genes that were identi-
fied to be significant within the UK Biobank ME/CFS
population, we found that 24 SNPs were also associ-
ated with long COVID in the Severe cohort. Of these
24 SNPs, 9 were critical (RF scored) within the Severe
long COVID population, mapping to 5 genes (Table 7).

In the Fatigue Dominant cohort, 27 SNPs were asso-
ciated with long COVID, of which 12 SNPs were also
common with the Severe cohort (Additional file 5:
Table S4). 7 of these 27 SNPs were critical (RF scored)
SNPs within the Fatigue Dominant long COVID cases,
mapping to 5 genes previously found in the ME/CFS
study (Table 7).

Comparison of long COVID genes identified with acute
COVID-19 studies

Whilst few GWAS significant variants have so far been
identified in long COVID [59], we sought to compare
the 73 unique genes identified in our long COVID
studies against the literature for any evidence within
severe COVID-19 and/or long COVID. Of these genes,
at least 9 have prior associations—such as differential
expression and genetic susceptibility analyses—to acute
COVID-19 after reviewing available publications in
PubMed and other data sources such as OpenTargets
(Table 8).

We also compared our results against the blood
derived gene expression signatures associated with
post-acute sequelae identified by Thompson et al. [64].
There are several key differences between the studies—
Thompson et al. recruited individuals hospitalized with
severe acute COVID-19 infection, whereas the major-
ity of individuals in our study experienced milder forms
of the disease (Table 1). We are also drawing compari-
sons from a transcriptomic study derived from whole
blood against a combinatorial study of germline genetic
variants.

Nonetheless, we found that 14 of the 73 genes
(Severe=7 and Fatigue Dominant =7) identified in our
analyses were also differentially expressed at the tran-
scriptomic level in patients experiencing long COVID
(Additional file 5: Table $10).

Fig. 9 Heatmap plot showing 19 biological processes (Gene Ontology biological process terms) shared between 73 long COVID genes identified
in the GOLD cohort and genes with genetic evidence in one or more indication groups (neurodegenerative, mental or behavioral, cardiovascular,
gastrointestinal, autoimmune and metabolic disorders). For each indication group, only the significantly enriched biological processes (p < 0.05) are
shown in blue and the intensity of the color is based on the p values of the Gene Ontology term in each indication group

Overlap between long COVID and other diseases

We identified genes with known genetic associations
across a wide range of complex diseases including neu-
rodegenerative, mental or behavioral, cardiovascular,
gastrointestinal, autoimmune and metabolic diseases
(see Additional file 5: Tables S8 and S9). We evaluated
the degree of overlap at a biological process level (using
mapping of genes to biological processes in Gene Ontol-
ogy [65, 66]) to identify the common pathophysiological
mechanisms that are shared between those diseases and
long COVID.

27 biological processes are significantly enriched in the
73 long COVID genes identified in this analysis, of which
19 processes are also significantly enriched in at least
one other indication group (Additional file 5: Table $13).
Based on these 19 pathways, long COVID genes shared
the greatest number of biological processes (> 50%) with
cardiovascular disease and mental or behavioral disease
followed by gastrointestinal disease, neurodegenera-
tive disease, autoimmune disease and metabolic disease
(Fig. 9, Additional file 5: Table $13).

Expanded genotypes analysis to detect causal features

We conducted expanded genotypes analysis (EGA) for all
Severe cohort RF scored genes (see Tables 3 and 4) found
in disease signatures with 2 or 3 SNP genotypes. These
comprise 5 genes corresponding to 23 disease signatures,

including a disease signature that contains two RF scored
genes (see Table 8).

We found that the critical SNP is universally protective
across at least 2 validated disease signatures for 3 of the
5 RF scored genes (ADIPOQ, NOL4, and PDE6C). That
is, when we control for the genotypes at the interacting
SNPs, expanded genotype signatures featuring at least
one copy of the critical SNP minor allele are consistently
associated with lower odds of severe long COVID rela-
tive to expanded genotype signatures with the homozy-
gous wild type genotype for the critical SNP. In all but
one of the remaining disease signatures for these genes,
the critical SNP minor allele is most often associated
with decreased odds of severe long COVID, with narrow
exceptions: i.e., when it fails to co-occur with the minor
allele of an interacting SNP (“SNP-specific protective
effect”) or when it co-occurs with a specific set of geno-
types at multiple interacting SNPs (“combination-specific
causative effect”).

The critical SNP minor alleles for these three genes are
typically associated with decreased risk of severe long
COVID, which either implies that they represent broadly
protective variants or causative variants that are in LD
with the wild type allele at the genotyped SNP. This rela-
tionship only becomes apparent, however, when we con-
trol for the confounding effects of other causative and/or
protective variants. Only one validated disease signature

for these three genes fails to exhibit a consistent biologi-
cal association between the critical SNP minor allele and
disease, indicating a potential false positive.

In contrast, the gene SNX9 is consistently associated
with more complex interactions that highlight the com-
binatorial dynamics of disease. For example, we identified
a disease signature comprising three SNPs that is asso-
ciated with strongly elevated odds of long COVID. This
disease signature includes:

+ critical SNP rs2025994 located approximately 40kb
upstream of the SNX9 coding region

+ interacting SNP rs6777173 located 12 kb upstream of
KLFIS

+ interacting SNP rs11072524 located in an intron of
RYR3

We also found that the SNX9 minor allele offers sig-
nificant protection against the risk of long COVID
among patients who possess a copy of the minor allele
at either interacting SNP (i.e., a SNP-specific protective
effect). That is, patients with the SNX9 heterozygous or

homozygous minor allele genotype consistently have
lower odds of developing severe long COVID than
patients with the SVX9 homozygous wild type genotype,
after controlling for the confounding effects of the geno-
types at the two interacting SNPs (see Table 9). Due to the
small sample sizes associated with many expanded geno-
type signatures, these individual comparisons are not
statistically significant. However, if we pool all patients
in this cohort, then patients with a copy of the SNX9
minor allele have significantly lower odds of disease than
patients who are homozygous for the SNX9 wild type
allele (odds ratio=0.52, 41 cases/134 controls vs. 316
cases/532 controls, Fisher’s Exact Test p=0.00047; note
that these totals include patients with rare expanded gen-
otype signatures not shown in Table 9).

A different pattern arises among patients who are
homozygous for the wild type genotype at both inter-
acting SNPs (Table 10). Here, patients with a copy of
the SNX9 minor allele have higher odds of disease than
patients who are homozygous for the SNX9 wild type
allele (odds ratio=1.86, 19 cases/22 controls vs. 74

2 1 0.49 (17:35) 0.38 (3:8) 0.77 (0.18-3.29)

We present comparisons for genotype combinations that are present in more than 10 patients (which excludes the 18 patients who are homozygous for the SNX9
minor allele). None of the EGA odds ratios for the individual comparisons are statistically significant after correcting for multiple testing. However, among patients
who possess a copy of the minor allele at either interacting SNP, presence of the SNX9 minor allele consistently results in lower odds of disease relative to the
homozygous wild type genotype (Fisher's Exact Test p = 0.00047). Among patients who possess only wild type alleles for both interacting SNPs, presence of the SNX9
minor allele results in higher odds of disease relative to the homozygous wild type genotype, but the difference is not statistically significant (Fisher's Exact Test

Taylor et al. Journal of Translational Medicine (2023) 21:775

cases/160 controls), although the odds ratio is not statis-
tically significant (Fisher’s Exact Test p=0.075).

Together these results suggest that the SNX9 geno-

type is a significant contributor to the risk of severe long
COVID infection, but that the gene-disease relationship
is context dependent and mediated by interactions with
KLF15 and RYR3. Similar non-linear interactions are
represented by three additional disease signatures com-
prised of the same SNX9 critical SNP and different inter-
acting SNPs. Monogenic approaches such as GWAS that
do not consider these gene—gene interactions can fail to
detect potentially important drivers of disease.
Finally, the expanded genotypes analysis did not pro-
vide any additional insight into the relationship between
DLC1 and disease. This could indicate that the biologi-
cal relationship between DLC1 is highly complex or that
the result is a false positive. However, the disease signa-
tures associated with strongly elevated odds of severe
long COVID all contain the rare homozygous minor
allele genotype for the DLCI critical SNP. Due to small
sample sizes, we were unable to analyze other expanded
genotype signatures containing the potentially causative
genotype. Thus, the ambiguous results may reflect the
fact that the relationship between the DLC minor allele
and long COVID does not carry over into heterozygous
patients.

Evaluation of potential novel drug targets and repurposing
opportunities

We evaluated the genes identified in the study to find
potential novel drug targets and their associated mech-
anistic patient stratification biomarkers (the disease
signatures that connect patient subgroups with the
mechanistic etiology for their disease). As described in
our previous ME/CFS paper, the use of combinatorial
analytics to identify novel targets has been validated in
other diseases such as ALS, where these novel targets
have demonstrated disease modifying activity in in vitro
models [67].

Of the 73 unique genes found across the two cohorts,
42 are potentially tractable targets for drug develop-
ment strategies based on annotations from OpenTargets
(defined by a score of greater than 0 across at least one
metric for tractability), see Additional file 5: Table S11.
This includes 26 targets that are suited to an antibody
approach and 18 that are amenable to modulation by
small molecules.

Most (>90%) of the genes are expressed in a wide
range of tissues (Additional file 5: Figure S7) although
the expression profile of the genes in specific cell types is
variable (Additional file 5: Figure S8). Approximately 44%
(n=30) of the genes are expressed in inhibitory neurons

Page 17 of 23

followed by 41% in excitatory neurons (n=28) and 40%
in oligodendrocyte precursor cells (n= 27).

Using a systematic repositioning approach [68], we
identified 13 long COVID targets that already have drugs
in clinical development. As these drugs or development
candidates may require fewer preclinical studies and
already have a known safety profile, they could represent
a quicker and de-risked strategy for developing poten-
tial new treatments. We are exploring the repurposing
potential of these compounds for the treatment of long
COVID and ME/CFS (where appropriate).

From this analysis for example, we identified TLR4 as
an attractive repurposing candidate. Our analysis indi-
cates that 52% of cases included the Severe long COVID
cohort had at least one disease signature containing a
variant in TLR4 and there is additional supporting evi-
dence that inhibition of TLR4 in a mouse model prevents
long term cognitive pathology such as synapse elimina-
tion and memory deficits that is caused by the SARS-
CoV-2 Spike protein [47]. Clinical studies have already
shown that antagonizing TLR4 signaling dampens the
pathological cytokine storm observed in patients with
severe acute COVID-19 and reduces mortality rates in
hospitalized COVID-19 patients [69, 70]. However, our
analysis also indicates that antagonism of TLR4 may
demonstrate therapeutic effects in long term pathology
caused by SARS-CoV-2.

We performed a search of the GlobalData [71] database
to further understand the number and stage of develop-
ment of TLR4 antagonists that are in clinical pipelines.
This revealed a total of 88 unique drugs that target TLR4
(either singularly or as part of a combination therapy),
including 8 in development for acute COVID-19, the
most advanced of which (Paridiprubart, Edesa Biotech
Inc) is currently being evaluated in a Phase 3 study in
hospitalized COVID-19 patients with Acute Respiratory
Distress Syndrome (ARDS) [72].

Discussion

As an approach to identify the drivers of the complex
disease biology of long COVID, combinatorial analytics
yields more useful signal than GWAS. No SNPs reached
the genome-wide significance threshold in either the
Severe or Fatigue Dominant cohorts. This underlines
the difficulties involved in using monogenic analysis
approaches to understanding disease associated genetic
variants and mechanistic etiologies in heterogeneous and
polygenic diseases, especially with small datasets.

Using combinatorial analytics, we identified 73 unique
genes in a long COVID population and highlighted the
relevance of subsets of these genes to the different sub-
cohorts of the disease population. At least 9 of the genes

--- Page 18 ---
Taylor et al. Journal of Translational Medicine (2023) 21:775

identified in this study have been linked to acute COVID-
19, and despite key differences in the study designs, we
also observe that 14 of the 73 genes were differentially
expressed in a transcriptomic analysis of long COVID
patients. We can form strong mechanism of action
hypotheses for each gene’s role in the development of
long COVID.

Splitting the population into two long COVID sub-
types, Severe and Fatigue Dominant, allowed us to
explore the genetic and biological differences underpin-
ning different clinical manifestations. The comparative
pathway enrichment analysis identified differences in
pathways between the genes uniquely associated with the
Severe long COVID group and those uniquely associated
with the Fatigue Dominant phenotype (Figure 8). The
greater number of genes involved in immune response in
the Severe long COVID cohort may also indicate a more
severe form of the acute infection. This may potentially
arise as a result of patients experiencing higher viral
loads than average, as we identified 4 genes that have
been functionally linked to SARS-CoV-2 host response
and/or acute severe COVID-19 (Table 5).

The pathway enrichment analysis also highlighted an
overrepresentation of genes involved in macrophage
foam cell differentiation. The formation of foam cells
leading to a profibrotic macrophage phenotype is criti-
cal in the development of atherosclerosis [73]. However,
there is also evidence that profibrotic pulmonary mac-
rophages contribute to acute respiratory distress syn-
drome (ARDS) and lung injury associated with patients
with severe COVID-19 [74].

The genes that were associated only with the Fatigue
Dominant long COVID cohort are enriched in MAPK
and JNK signaling cascades as well as other metabolic
processes involved in mitochondrial function and cel-
lular respiration (Table 6). As discussed in our previous
ME/CFS paper, dysregulated mitochondrial function,
resulting in the inability to increase respiration rates in
response to increased demand from stressors such as
exercise [75], may result in the post-exertional malaise
(PEM) that is a hallmark of ME/CFS. The finding of
similar pathways in the Fatigue Dominant long COVID
cohort suggests that these patients may also struggle to
meet energy demands.

It is known that NK cell effector function (cytotoxic
activity) regulated by MAPK signaling cascades, includ-
ing via the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) [76] signal-
ing pathway, is dysregulated within patients with ME/
CFS, who exhibit reduced NK cell cytotoxic activity
[77]. Further work will be required to confirm if similar
pathological events occur in patients who develop fatigue
dominant long COVID.

Page 18 of 23

When we evaluated the degree of similarity between
the genes associated with ME/CFS and long COVID, we
found 13 critical SNPs (39 in total) within at least one of
the long COVID populations that could be mapped to a
gene previously associated with ME/CFS.

In both Severe and Fatigue Dominant long COVID
populations, we identified SNPs mapping to the genes
ATP9A, INSR, CLOCK, SLC1SA4 and GPCS. All of these
genetic variants were found in a higher proportion of the
Fatigue Dominant and Severe long COVID populations
than in the ME/CFS case group. This finding may indi-
cate that the long COVID case group defined by fatigue
symptoms is more homogenous than those within the
self-reported UK Biobank ME/CFS population, which
likely includes a mix of viral and non-viral triggers of
chronic fatigue symptoms.

We found that the CLOCK gene is significantly associ-
ated with Fatigue Dominant long COVID and ME/CFS.
CLOCK (Circadian Locomotor Output Cycles Kaput)
is an important regulator of circadian rhythm, disrup-
tions of which have been associated with pain, insomnia,
insulin resistance, immunological function and impaired
mitochondrial function [78—82]. Interestingly, one of the
most common variants identified in~ 86% of the long
COVID Fatigue Dominant population mapped to the
gene NLGN1. NLGN1 is also transcriptionally activated
by CLOCK in the forebrain [83], which could indicate
multiple genetic contributions to dysregulated circadian
rhythm in long COVID.

Of the remaining 4 genes common between long
COVID and ME/CFS, we identified 3 common variants
in the genes ATP9A, INSR and SLCISA4 in both Severe
and Fatigue Dominant cohorts (Table 7).

SLCISA4 encodes a transmembrane transport that
has previously been associated with inflammatory auto-
immune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus
from genome-wide association studies [84, 85]. However,
SLC15A4 also plays a key role in mitochondrial func-
tion, with knock down of the gene resulting in impaired
autophagy and mitochondrial membrane potential under
cellular stress [86].

We also hypothesized that the genetic variants in
ATP9A and INSR both contribute to dysregulated insulin
signaling in subgroups of ME/CFS patients. Type 2 dia-
betes-related signaling pathways and insulin resistance
were also a key theme within the genes associated with
long COVID, and 11 of the gene targets identified in this
analysis have prior associations with type 2 diabetes in
the OpenTargets database (Additional file 5: Table $12).
Metabolic dysfunction and type 2 diabetes may increase
risk of developing severe acute COVID-19 [87] and epi-
demiological studies have demonstrated that there is an

--- Page 19 ---
Taylor et al. Journal of Translational Medicine (2023) 21:775

increased risk of developing diabetes post COVID-19
compared against controls who had not been infected
with SARS-CoV-2 [88]. Furthermore, increased inci-
dence of insulin resistance and glycemic dysregulation
was observed in patients 2 months post COVID-19 and
in long COVID patients [32, 89].

Several of the biological processes that genes identi-
fied in this study are significantly enriched for—such
as foam cell differentiation—are also associated with
known genetic links to metabolic diseases such as type
2 diabetes (Figure). Metabolic dysfunction has a variety
of biological consequences, including increased levels of
chronic inflammation, dysregulated immune response to
acute infection, endothelial cell dysfunction and defects
in coagulation pathways. All of these have been linked to
long COVID and severe acute COVID-19 pathogenesis
[90].

It is therefore plausible that patients with genetic vari-
ants that predispose them to metabolic dysfunction and
insulin resistance are more likely to suffer from long term
pathological sequelae after the acute phase of COVID-19
infection. From these findings we would indeed expect
this population to have increased rates of new-onset type
2 diabetes compared to the non-long COVID population.
Unfortunately, longitudinal health record data after the
survey was completed was not available to validate this
hypothesis in this analysis.

Similarities in indications observed from the cross-dis-
ease analysis have also highlighted shared pathways and
biological processes associated with genetic drivers of
these indications. The results are supported by common
clinical manifestations reported in long COVID stud-
ies. Of the 27 pathways significantly enriched in the long
COVID genes identified in this analysis, 16 (60%) are
associated with gene targets previously associated with
mental or behavioral disease (Figure 9). This includes
indications such as major depressive disorder, anxi-
ety disorder and schizophrenia. A recent meta-analysis
of over 10,000 patients indicated that neurological and
neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as brain fog, atten-
tion deficits and fatigue, were some of the most reported
3 months after acute COVID-19 [91]. This analysis may
indicate some of the genetic underpinnings of these man-
ifestations post-COVID.

Study limitations

There are several limitations to this study. The most obvi-
ous is that the available datasets, even in a disease as top-
ical, prevalent, and debilitating as long COVID are still
very small, which notwithstanding the improved sensitiv-
ity offered by the combinatorial analytics approach, inev-
itably poses limits on the statistical power of the study.

Page 19 of 23

The most challenging limitation is the poor represen-
tation of diverse ancestries, which is essential to gain a
deeper understanding of the variability of disease etiol-
ogy and achieve a level of health equity. As demonstrated
by the cohort analysis, even though considerable effort
was made to recruit as diverse a population as possible,
the majority of participants recruited to the GOLD study
were of self-reported white Caucasian ancestry. It is evi-
dent that long COVID is a highly heterogeneous disease
with a variety of different symptoms, clinical presenta-
tions and underlying disease mechanisms including neu-
rological and metabolic dysregulation. From this dataset,
we cannot understand the varying prevalence of these
symptoms, or the effects that different genetic ancestries,
socioeconomic factors, pathogen exposure levels or geo-
graphical differences may have in influencing the risk and
presentation of long COVID in different ancestries.

Our cohort analysis also revealed that the incidence of
other comorbidities (such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovas-
cular disease etc.) was lower than expected for a cohort
with the same average age as the long COVID popula-
tion. This may indicate a degree of ‘otherwise healthy’
volunteer bias that limits this dataset as a representative
sample of long COVID. Alternatively, it could reflect a
problem with under-reporting of other medical condi-
tions within the self-reported questionnaire.

All the non-genomic data was self-reported by the
participants via a questionnaire upon recruitment to
the study, including long COVID symptoms, level of
acute COVID-19 severity and medical history. Unfor-
tunately, no further EHR/primary care data was avail-
able. This method for reporting the degree of long
COVID symptoms experienced is likely to be more
subjective and prone to memory lapses and retrospec-
tive interpretation than direct and concurrent clinical
information. This creates challenges in identifying the
most relevant clusters of long COVID symptoms (e.g.,
respiratory, fatigue, GI etc.) and evaluating the severity
of those symptoms experienced by different subgroups
of cases.

We were unable to fully evaluate some of the most
significant consequences and secondary diagnoses
associated with long COVID disease. In particular,
we would have liked to evaluate the specific drivers
underlying the development of POTS, which was only
recorded as part of participants’ free-text responses and
not captured in the main questionnaire. In the absence
of consistent diagnosis and clinical reporting for POTS,
we attempted to analyze the symptoms that patients
reported when recruited to the study. Tachycardia, diz-
ziness, palpitations, brain fog and even in some cases
POTS were recorded but in insufficient numbers for a
meaningful analysis.

--- Page 20 ---
Taylor et al. Journal of Translational Medicine (2023) 21:775

Hospital admission with a more severe form of acute
COVID-19 has previously been identified as a risk fac-
tor for the development of long COVID [92]. We were
unable to test this finding, as fewer than 10% of any of
our case cohorts were hospitalized with COVID-19. As
a result, there was insufficient data available to explore
if long COVID cases with the 9 variants mapped to
genes previously associated with acute COVID-19
(Table 8) were more likely to have experienced a more
severe form of acute COVID-19.

Finally, there is some emerging evidence that vacci-
nation against COVID-19 may be protective against the
development of long COVID [93]. The analysis of our
cohort does show a small but significant reduction in
the severity of symptoms over the course of the period
Jan 2020-Nov 2022. The majority of cases included in
our study were first infected in 2020 or early 2021 (pre-
widespread vaccination) but the questionnaire did not
contain any questions regarding vaccination/booster
status, or if the participants contracted acute COVID-
19 before or after vaccination. As such, we are unable
to evaluate the effect of vaccination on long COVID
development within this cohort.

There is some additional evidence that omicron vari-
ants are less likely to cause long-term symptoms even
after adjusting for vaccine status [94] and the evidence
available in this study does not contradict that sugges-
tion. However, as demonstrated by our cohort analysis,
it was difficult to assess the association of SARS-CoV-2
variant status with long COVID risk due to the limited
number of study participants recruited who contracted
COVID-19 when omicron and more recent variants
were the most prevalent in the UK, the limited amount
of information on repeat infections, or vaccination/
booster status.

Conclusions and future perspectives

The results of this study, while encouraging and build-
ing consistently on findings in ME/CFS and other
diseases with related symptomology, still need to be
validated and replicated within an independent long
COVID population, which ideally would have much
deeper clinical phenotype and longitudinal history
information.

Various groups have been collecting large acute
COVID-19 and long COVID patient datasets over
the last 3 years and we hope that they will now make
the individual patient level data available to the wider
research community quickly. We can realistically
expect that analyzing an independent, larger and more
detailed patient dataset using combinatorial analytics
approaches will further improve the disease insights
that we are gaining in long COVID, offering routes

forward to alleviate the massive unmet medical need
which has blighted the lives of millions of patients.

Abstract

Background

Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is a complex condition
involving multiple organ systems and characterized by persistent/relapsing debilitating
fatigue, immune dysfunction, neurological problems, and other symptoms not curable for at
least 6 months. Disruption of DNA methylation patterns has been tied to various immune
and neurological diseases; however, its status in ME/CFS remains uncertain. Our study
aimed at identifying changes in the DNA methylation patterns that associate with ME/CFS.

Methods

We extracted genomic DNA from peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 13 ME/CFS
study subjects and 12 healthy controls and measured global DNA methylation by ELISA-like
method and site-specific methylation status using Illumina MethylationEPIC microarrays.
Pyrosequencing validation included 33 ME/CFS cases and 31 controls from two geographi-
cally distant cohorts.

Results

Global DNA methylation levels of ME/CFS cases were similar to those of controls. However,
microarray-based approach allowed detection of 17,296 differentially methylated CpG sites
in 6,368 genes across regulatory elements and within coding regions of genes. Analysis of
DNA methylation in promoter regions revealed 307 differentially methylated promoters.
Ingenuity pathway analysis indicated that genes associated with differentially methylated
promoters participated in at least 15 different pathways mostly related to cell signaling with a
strong immune component.

the manuscript.

Competing interests: The authors have declared
that no competing interests exist.

Conclusions

This is the first study that has explored genome-wide epigenetic changes associated with
ME/CFS using the advanced Illumina MethylationEPIC microarrays covering about 850,000
CpG sites in two geographically distant cohorts of ME/CFS cases and matched controls.
Our results are aligned with previous studies that indicate a dysregulation of the immune
system in ME/CFS. They also suggest a potential role of epigenetic de-regulation in the
pathobiology of ME/CFS. We propose screening of larger cohorts of ME/CFS cases to
determine the external validity of these epigenetic changes in order to implement them as
possible diagnostic markers in clinical setting.

1. Introduction

Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is a condition that is charac-
terized by an abrupt or delayed onset of persistent/relapsing symptomatology including mem-
ory and other neurological problems, muscle and joint pain, gastrointestinal issues, hormonal
imbalance, immune dysfunction and debilitating fatigue. Moreover, such symptoms are usu-
ally unresolved with bed rest and are severe enough to impair average daily activity below 50
percent of usual activity level, lasting for a period of at least six months [1].

While the mechanism of ME/CFS remains unclear and diagnostic methods exclusively rely
on symptomatology presentation and exclusion of laboratory findings, research efforts have
demonstrated that ME/CFS impacts the endocrine, neurological, immune and metabolic pro-
cesses resulting in impaired physiological homeostasis [2-4].

Statistical studies estimate the prevalence of ME/CFS at 0.23 to 0.41 percent [5, 6] of the
general population, with a female to male ratio of 6:1 [7]. With this prevalence, annual costs to
the United States economy have been estimated at $9 billion in lost productivity and up to $24
billion in health care expenditures [8-10]. Therefore, it seems that ME/CFS not only impacts
an individual’s overall well-being and quality of life, but it also has far reaching effects on the
society and economy and constitutes a significant public health concern.

Currently, treatment of ME/CFS relies only on the management of symptomatology [11]
and improvement in quality of life due to a lack of understanding of the mechanisms under-
pinning disease onset and progression, limiting treatment options to partial and/or temporary
relief of symptoms [11]. While some advances have been made in identifying molecular
changes associated with ME/CFS, its complexity and the involvement of multiple organ sys-
tems have hindered the exact causes of the disease [12]. An improved understanding of the key

molecular mechanisms of ME/CFS and dysfunction within regulatory systems will translate
into appropriate diagnostic methods and management of cases, providing more targeted
approaches to treatment.

Disruption of epigenetic mechanisms is linked to various immune, neurological and endo-
crine diseases [13-15]. Furthermore, DNA methylation patterns were found to be altered in
several diseases often reported as comorbid to ME/CFS such as fibromyalgia (FM) and irritable
bowel syndrome (IBS) [16, 17]. With respect to ME/CFS, we are aware of only a few studies,
which examined differences in DNA methylation patterns between ME/CFS cases and controls
[18-20]. These studies used Illumina Human Methylation450 BeadChip microarrays, which
allow to analyze over 450,000 methylation sites per sample at single-nucleotide resolution.
Other two additional studies limited the analysis to specific gene promoter regions using a

DNA methylation in ME/CFS

site-specific approach for measuring DNA methylation in ME/CFS cases [21, 22]. The recently
released Illumina MethylationEPIC microarrays allow analysis of DNA methylation changes
on over 850,000 CpG sites [23]. This additional coverage should facilitate uncovering addi-
tional changes in transcription regulation present in ME/CFS subjects. In addition, by validat-
ing DNA methylation patterns associating with ME/CFS in 64 participants from two
geographically distant independent cohorts using pyrosequencing, we identified consensus
CpG hypomethylated sites which could be used in future screenings of associations of these
epigenetic changes in ME/CFS. Therefore, this study intended to validate and build upon the
previous analysis of genome-wide DNA methylation changes in ME/CFS and extend such
findings by utilizing larger coverage of CpG sites. Future validation studies in larger cohorts of
ME/CFS cases are warranted to provide reliable epigenetic markers in ME/CFS.

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Sample collection and processing

2.1.1. Cohort recruitment. ME/CFS cases and controls were recruited from two loca-
tions: the Miami/Fort Lauderdale (Florida) area and Valencia, Spain as part of larger bio-
marker-oriented studies. All subjects had comparable age and body mass index (BMI)

(Table 1). Because females are affected by ME/CFS more than males (6:1 ratio) [7], we
recruited only female participants to reduce potential confounding effects. For inclusion we
utilized the Fukuda [24] and Canadian [25] case definitions. Fukuda requiring fatigue of
greater than 6 months duration and 4 of 8 symptom criteria including exercise induced
relapse, myalgia, arthralgia, headache of a new and different type, non-restorative sleep, cogni-
tive complaints, sore throat and tender lymph nodes [24], and Canadian requiring exercise
induced relapse and symptoms form at least of 3 categories (immune, autonomic, endocrine)
[25].

All ME/CFS study subjects had the Medical Outcomes Study 36-item short-form survey
(SF-36) summary physical score below the 50th percentile, based on population norms. All
subjects were between 30 and 60 years old when samples were collected.

Exclusion criteria: all ME/CFS subjects, selected by their medical history and physical
examination, had no history of malignancy or other systemic disorders including the listed
psychiatric exclusions required for a diagnosis of ME/CFS, as clarified by Reeves [26], using

DNA methylation in ME/CFS

the Composite International Diagnostic Instrument (a computerized interview format assess-
ment of comorbid or exclusionary psychiatric diagnoses) [27]. Additional exclusion criteria
included: active smoking or alcohol history, taking medications that could potentially impact
immune function (e.g. steroids, immune-suppressors, etc.), taking diuretics, beta blockers, cal-
cium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors, as well as subjects with a BMI > 35. Controls were
self-defined as healthy, sedentary (no regular exercise program, sedentary employment), and
matched to ME/CFS cases by age (+/- 5 years), race/ethnicity and BMI (+/- 5). All subjects
were asked to complete the Gynecologic Questionnaire to assess routine gynecologic parame-
ters and were asked to come for the assessment and collection of blood during the first two
weeks of their menstrual cycle if premenopausal.

All subjects signed an informed consent approved by the Institutional Review Board of the
Nova Southeastern University. Ethics review and approval for the subjects from Valencia was
obtained from Hospital de La Plana (Villarreal, Spain) Ethics Committee. All subjects from
Valencia (Spain) signed an informed consent before they could be included in the study.

The following questionnaires were completed for all enrolled subjects (cases and controls):

the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI) [28] to measure fatigue, the SF-36 [29] to assess
health-related quality of life, the Krupp Fatigue Severity Inventory (Krupp FSI) [30] to measure
perception of fatigue severity, the Sickness Impact Profile [31] to measure the impact of symp-

toms on the activities of daily life.

Student t-test was used to assess statistical difference between ME/CFS cases and controls
in SF-36 scores for physical and mental health.

2.1.3. Isolation of PBMCs and DNA extractions. Blood samples (8 ml) collected and kept
at room temperature in K,EDTA (Becton Dickinson) were processed within 2 h by dilution at
1:1 (v/v) ratio in phosphate-buffered saline solution (PBS), layering on top of 1 volume of Ficoll-
Paque Premium (GE Healthcare) and separation by density centrifugation at 20°C at 500 g for 30
min (brakes off). The PBMC layer was isolated and washed with PBS. The isolated PBMC pellets
were resuspended in 1 volume of red blood cell lysis buffer (155 mM NH,Cl, 10 mM NaHCO;,
pH 7.4, and 0.1 mM EDTA), kept on ice for 5 min, and centrifuged (20°C, 500 g, 10 min). The
washed pellets were resuspended in freezing medium (90% FBS, 10% DMSO) adjusting their
concentration to 10” cells/ml, aliquoted and frozen at -150°C or liquid nitrogen until use. Geno-
mic DNA was extracted from rapidly thawed PBMCs using DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (Qiagen),
according to manufacturer’s instructions. In brief, pelleted PBMCs were resuspended in 200 ul

of PBS supplemented with proteinase K and RNase A and genomic DNA was obtained from
treated lysates using the kit binding columns and binding/wash/elution standard conditions.
DNA quality and concentration were assessed by Agilent TapeStation 4200 (Agilent Technolo-
gies). All DNA samples had DNA Integrity Number (DIN) above 8 (data not shown).

2.2. Genomic DNA methylation profiling

For global epigenetic measurements MethylFlash Methylated DNA 5-mC Quantification Kit
(EpiGentek) and MethylFlash Methylated DNA 5-hmC Quantification Kit (EpiGentek) have
been used with 100 ng of genomic DNA from each sample. DNA methylation and DNA
hydroxy-methylation were quantified using 5-methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymetylcytosine
respectively by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-like reaction as previously described
[32, 33]. The levels of methylated DNA were calculated using the absorbance on a microplate
reader at 450 nm. Results were normalized against a standard curve prepared according the
manufacturer’s protocol using reference 0-100% methylated standards.

For genome-wide DNA methylation assessment 500 ng of genomic DNA from each sample
was submitted to the Center of Genome Technology of the John P. Hussman Institute for

DNA methylation in ME/CFS

Human Genomics in the Miller School of Medicine University of Miami. Genomic DNA was
bisulfite converted using the EZ DNA Methylation Kit (Zymo Research), and after processing,
according to Illumina’s specifications, DNA was hybridized to Illumina MethylationEPIC
microarrays [34].

2.3. Analysis of genomic DNA methylation data

Signal intensity data (IDAT files) were imported into R/Bioconductor (v.3.3.1) package
RnBeads (v.1.2.0) [35]. Methylation values for each of the probes on the Illumina Methylatio-
nEPIC microarray were produced as beta-values, calculated as the ratio of methylated probe
intensity over total intensity (methylated and unmethylated) for each probe, which range from
0 to 1, roughly corresponding to the methylation percentage of the probe [35]. Low-quality
data (probes with detection p-value > 0.01) were removed from the analysis. Probes outside of
the context (non-CpG) and invariable through all sample probes were filtered out. Probes
overlapping SNPs were removed using RnBeads function “rnb.execute.snp.removal” with the
option “snp =“any””. The resulting data set (649,836 probes) was normalized using BMIQ nor-
malization of RnBeads package [36] and used for exploratory and differential methylation

analysis. Differential methylation analysis was performed by using two strategies: genomic
region-based and site-based. While the genomic region-based approach looks for the average
methylation level of the genomic region (CpG islands, promoters, genes, and genome-wide til-
ing regions) and then compares the methylation status of the regions across samples, site-
based approach analyses the CpG loci are analyzed one at a time. To detect regions or loci that
are differentially methylated in ME/CFS cases compared to controls we used R/Bioconductor

limma package [37] incorporated into RnBeads analysis. CpG sites were considered to be dif-
ferentially methylated if they met the following selection criteria: the absolute beta-value differ-
ence between the mean beta-values of cases and controls was greater than 0.05, and false
discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05 using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure [38] for microarray-
based analysis and p< 0.05 according to the Student t-test for pyrosequencing-based analysis.
Promoter regions (1500 bp upstream of the transcription start site (TSS) and 500 bp down-
stream of TSS) were considered to be differentially methylated if they met the following crite-
ria: FDR < 0.1 according to Benjamini-Hochberg procedure [38] and the absolute beta-value
difference between the mean beta-values of cases and controls was greater than 0.05. RnBeads
calculates the combined rank score for differential DNA methylation to each genomic region.
This combined rank is defined as the maximum (worst) of three individual rankings of 1) by
absolute difference in mean DNA methylation levels in the genomic region, 2) by the relative
difference in mean DNA methylation levels, which is calculated as the absolute value of the
logarithm of the quotient of mean DNA methylation levels, and 3) by the CpG-based or geno-
mic region-based p-value that is combined from CpG-specific p-values of the region using an

extension of Fisher’s method. We present our data in the Supplementary Tables ordered by
the combined rank.
The raw microarray data have been deposited in Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) at

NCBI (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) under the accession number GSE111183.

2.4. Validation of differentially methylated promoters by pyrosequencing

For validation of the data obtained with the Illumina MethylationEPIC microarrays by pyrose-
quencing, genomic DNA was treated with EZ DNA Methylation-Gold Kit (Zymo Research)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Methylation of DNA was quantified with bisulfite
treatment of DNA and simultaneous PCR. A 50-ul PCR was performed in 25 ul of GoTaq
Green Master mix (Promega), with 1 pmol of biotinylated forward primer, 1 pmol of reverse

primer and 50 ng of bisulfite treated genomic DNA. The primer sequences for TABPB were:
forward—5’- GTGGATTTTGGGTGGGGATTA-3’ and reverse—5’- AACTCCCACCAAAC
CATCCTTACC-3’ ;for ZBTB18 were: forward—5’ - GAGTTTGAGGAGATGTATTTGATA
TT-3/ and reverse—5’- AACTTTTCAACCAATTTATAAATCTTTTCT-3’. The PCR was
followed by pyrosequencing, using conditions previously described [33]. Results were reported
as the percentage of the 5-methylated cytosines with respect to total, methylated and unmethy-
lated, cytosines. Additionally, non-CpG cytosine residues were used as internal controls to val-
idate bisulfite conversion.

2.5. Ingenuity pathway analysis

Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software (IPA, Qiagen) was used to annotate genes with differen-
tially methylated promoters (DMPs) and rank associated canonical pathways. Canonical path-
ways analysis identified the pathways from the IPA library of pathways that were most
significant to the set of genes with DMPs. The significance of the association between a gene
set and a canonical pathway was measured by determining the ratio between the number of
genes in our list that mapped to the canonical pathway divided by the total number of all
known genes that mapped to that pathway. Fisher’s exact test was used to calculate p-values
determining the probability that the association between the genes in the dataset and the
canonical pathway was explained by chance alone.

microarrays, as detailed in Methods. These arrays can assay over 850,000 CpG sites and cover
different regions across genes, including promoter, 5’ UTR, first exon, gene body, and 3’ UTR,
as well as and distant regions. Coverage includes 99% of RefSeq genes with multiple probes per
gene, 96% of CpG islands from the UCSC (University of California, Santa Cruz) database and
additional content imputed from whole-genome bisulfite sequencing data [23]. Following data
analysis, the obtained results were validated by pyrosequencing on the samples from the experi-
mental cohort, as well as on additional 8 ME/CFS cases and 8 controls from Miami/Fort Lau-
derdale area and 12 ME/CFS cases and 11 controls from Valencia (Spain), as described in
Methods.

It is worth noting that previous studies have had similar number of cases and controls using
different Illumina Human Methylation450 microarrays. For example, Brenu et al [20] included
25 ME/CFS cases with 18 controls and measured methylation in T-cells; whereas De Vega et al
[18] included 12 ME/CFS cases and 12 controls and measured methylation status in PBMCs.
Hence, our sample size is similar to these previous publications for statistical comparison.
Moreover, the major strength of the current findings is depicted in the validation of specific
CpG sites in an expanded cohort of ME/CFS cases and controls from a different geographical
location i.e. Valencia, Spain. However, additional validation in a larger cohort is warranted.

Table 1 shows age and BMI matching of all ME/CFS cases and controls in the experimental
cohort and in the 39 additional samples from two distant geographic locations (used for pyro-
sequencing validation). Vitality, social functioning, role emotional and mental health were sig-
nificantly lower in ME/CFS cases compared to controls. In addition, statistically significant
differences in physical health were found when cases were compared to controls, according to
SF-36 scores. S1 and S2 Tables show age, BMI and SF-36 scores for the two separate cohorts,
one from Florida, USA, and the other from Valencia, Spain, correspondingly.

3.2. Global methylation in ME/CFS

We did not find statistically significant differences in global DNA methylation levels using
ELISA-based assay methods to detect either 5-methylcytosine (5-mC) or 5-hydroxymethylcy-
tosine (5-hmC) modifications on DNA isolated from PBMCs of ME/CFS cases and controls
(S3 Table). This analysis, however, shows overall cytosine modifications but it is limited at
detecting specific fluctuations at particular locations in the genome.

Since former studies had shown site specific methylation differences in ME/CFS [18-21],
we proceeded to evaluate this possibility in our experimental cohort, however, we used an
upgraded version of the microarrays for human genome-wide methylation studies (Illumina
Infinium Human MethylationEPIC microarrays). This novel technology which has almost
twice coverage compared to that of previous Illumina HumanMethylation450 microarrays
[36] may allow for validation and additions to previous findings in independent, geographi-
cally distant, cohorts of ME/CFS cases.

3.3. Differentially methylated CpG sites in ME/CFS

Data from the microarray-based genome-wide methylation analysis of the experimental cohort
showed hypomethylation of the differentially methylated sites (DMS) (98%) in PBMCs from
ME/CES cases compared to controls.

As many as 649,836 probes remained for normalization and further analysis upon filtering
and preprocessing of the raw genomic DNA methylation data with the R/Bioconductor v.3.3.1
RnBeads package v.1.2.0. Analysis of these probes led to the finding of 17,296 DMS located in
6,368 annotated genes indicating epigenetic differences between the ME/CFS cases and con-
trols in experimental cohort when we used FDR < 0.05 criteria. S4 Table shows the list of

DMS along with their respective gene references. Furthermore, Principal Component Analysis
(PCA) of full methylomes clearly differentiated between ME/CFS cases and controls as shown
in Fig 2. In addition, unsupervised hierarchical clustering of the 500 most variable CpG sites
(according to RnBeads ranking, see Methods) shows clear segregation between ME/CFS cases
and controls (Fig 3) confirming that methylation DNA patterns of PBMCs in ME/CFS individ-
uals differ from those of controls.

Out of the 17,296 DMS, a total of 14,261 DMS (82%) were found within or proximal to
genes (i.e., genic locations) indicating that they may have a role in regulation of gene expres-
sion. About 98% of the DMS within the genic regions were hypomethylated and 2% were
hypermethylated overall (Fig 4A and $4 Table). These DMS were mostly equally distributed
between gene bodies (43.68%) and gene regulatory elements (combined TSS1500, TSS200, 5”
UTR and 3’ UTR) (43.84%). Hypomethylation of ME/CFS DNA was observed on about
21.87% of DMS located in TSS regions; 17.21% in 5’ UTRs; 3.08% in 1st exons and 4.25% in 3’
UTRs. Hypermethylation, on the other hand, appeared on 0.16% of DMS located in TSS
regions, 0.34% in 5 and 3’ UTRs, and 0.79% in gene bodies (Fig 4A). Regarding to the location
relation to CpG islands, out of 17,296 DMS, 46.8% were located in CpG islands, whereas
53.2% (8,089 DMS) belong to proximity of CpG islands and CpG islands. As shown in Fig 4B,
the mapping of 8,089 DMS with respect to their location in CpG islands shows that 99.3% of
these 8,089 DMS are hypomethylated and only 0.7% were hypermethylated. Fig 4B also shows
that out of these 8,089 DMS, approximately 25.25% were located within CpG islands, 61.9%
mapped 2 kb upstream and downstream of CpG islands (N, S Shores), and 12.8% of them
localized to regions 2 kb upstream and downstream of CpG shores (N, S Shelves). Within
these regions, 74.1% of shores and shelves were hypomethylated, while only 0.63% of CpG
island shores and shelves were hypermethylated, consistent with the general finding of hypo-
methylation being associated to ME/CFS. More relaxed criteria (FDR < 0.1 and mean beta
differences > 0.05) allowed to identify 27,129 DMS as listed in S5 Table.

3.4. Differentially methylated promoters in ME/CFS

Since methylation of promoter regions directly affect levels of gene expression, we proceeded
to analyze differentially methylated promoters (DMPs) in our experimental cohort. As
described in Methods, promoters were defined in RnBeads package as regions located between
1,500 bp upstream of TSS and 500 bp downstream of TSS. Criteria for DMPs were FDR < 0.1
with the mean beta differences > 0.05. Using these criteria, we found 307 DMPs in PBMCs of
ME/CES cases. S6 Table lists these DMPs ranked according to the RnBeads package [35]. 306
of these DMPs are hypomethylated in the ME/CFS group while only one appeared hyper-
methylated. Fig 5 shows the distribution of these promoters according to their gene biotype.
Almost half of the identified DMPs belong to protein-coding genes (47.6%), and more than
half (52.1%) belong to regulatory RNA genes. The last consisted of short non-coding RNAs
(including miRNAs, small nuclear RNAs, small nucleolar RNAs) (10.1%), long non-coding
RNAs (including antisense RNAs and intergenic RNAs) (30.6%), and pseudogenes (11.4%).
This distribution of DMPs supports our hypothesis that the differential methylation observed
might lead to deregulation of gene expression in ME/CFS. We also identified 144 DMPs with
more stringent criteria of FDR < 0.05 with the mean beta differences > 0.05 as listed in S7
Table; and it represents similar gene-function patterns as DMPs identified with FDR < 0.1.

3.5. Functional pathway analysis of DMPs

To further understand the potential functions and interactions between the 307 genes con-
trolled by DMPs within the context of cell biological pathways, we performed Gene Ontology

analysis through Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). As illustrated in Fig 6, this analysis
revealed changes in numerous immunoregulatory/stress-response pathways such as the p38
MAPK pathway (involved in response to a variety of environmental stresses and to inflamma-
tory cytokines [39]), the IL-10, IL-17A, Il-1 and IL-8 signaling pathways (all with important
immunoregulatory roles, [40, 41]), the AMPK pathway (master regulator of cellular energy
homeostasis that is activated in response to stresses that deplete cellular ATP supplies [42])
and metabolic pathways such as PPARa/RXRo activation and uracil and thymine degradation
pathways [43, 44]. Furthermore, functional analysis of numerous individual genes revealed
hypomethylation in promoters of the IGHJ1, IGHJ1P, IGHJ4, IGHJ5, IGHJ6, IGHJ3P,
IGHV3-7, IGHD7-27, IGLL1 and LRMP genes (S5 Table) which are related to B cell immune
response, differentiation, proliferation and survival [45]. Similarly, ME/CFS cases showed
decreased DNA methylation level in promoters of genes responsible for T cell generation and
activity, such as ZCCHC11, CAPNS, IL21R, P2RX5, TREML2, AKNA and CD248 [46]. Along
with a robust impact in immune response pathways, PMBCs of ME/CFS cases showed
decreased methylation of promoters of genes associated with cell growth that targeted the
MAP Kinase, NF-kB, and TGF signaling pathways (S5 Table and Fig 6). In addition, a distinct

3.6. Validation of Illumina MethylationEPIC microarray results by
pyrosequencing

To validate the results of our analysis obtained with Illumina MethylationEPIC microarrays,
we selected two DMPs that had high density of CpG sites and possible ME/CFS relevance by
their role in the neuro-immune signaling axis. The first, corresponding to the Zinc Finger and
BTB Domain Containing 18 (ZBTB18), is a zinc finger transcriptional repressor with a crucial
role in brain development and neuronal differentiation. The second, TABPB, encodes a

DNA methylation in ME/CFS

transmembrane glycoprotein which mediates interaction between newly assembled major histo-
compatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules and the transporter associated with antigen pro-
cessing (TAP), which is required for the transport of antigenic peptides across the endoplasmic
reticulum. ZBTB18 is in the upper top list of DMPs by order of RnBeads combined rank (posi-
tion 8 of 307 in S5 Table); while TABPB is in the lower part (position 246 of 307 in S5 Table),
thus we included DMPs with values at both ends of the range in the validation step. For each of
the 2 selected genes, we assayed the level of DNA methylation of six CpG sites in the promoter
area. For ZBTB18, three of the CpG sites corresponded to oligonucleotides printed on Illumina
MethylationEPIC microarrays, and three additional CpG sites not included in microarray con-
tent but located in the gene promoter region between cg15896892 and cg19698993, were also
tested. In the case of the TABPB gene, all the assayed CpG sites correlated with probes included
in Illumina MethylationEPIC microarrays. As summarized in Fig 7, pyrosequencing analysis
strongly validated the direction of methylation differences between ME/CFS and control subjects
(p < 0.01) as identified by Illumina MethylationEPIC microarray (FDR < 0.05) in all CpG sites
assayed. Importantly, it was observed that the methylation levels detected by pyrosequencing in
ME/CFS individuals were similar to those observed by MethylationEPIC microarrays in all DMS
(Fig 7), and that the differences in methylation levels assayed by pyrosequencing were even more
pronounced than the same differences assayed by microarrays (Fig 7).

4. Discussion

DNA methylation plays an important role in the interplay between external (environment)
and internal (gene expression) factors and thus may explain the late or stimulus-triggered

DNA methylation in ME/CFS

on-set of multisystem complex diseases such as ME/CFS. However, only a few studies have
reported changes in DNA methylation associated to ME/CFS [18-20]. Here, we used a newer
and improved, technology developed by Illumina Inc. that was not available at the time the
preceding studies were performed, with the intention of expanding previous findings. Illumina
MethylationEPIC microarrays have almost twice the coverage of CpG sites compared to the
older Illumina HumanMethylation450 microarrays, including 333,265 additional CpGs
located in regulatory regions as identified by the ENCODE and FANTOMS projects [36].
Here, we identified differentially methylated CpG sites and promoters in PBMCs of ME/
CFS cases compared to controls in cohorts from two distant geographic locations. Association
of hypomethylation of DMPs with immune regulatory pathway is in agreement with previous
studies [18-20]. Those previous studies found immune cell regulation as the largest coordi-
nated enrichment of differentially methylated pathways and reported genomic DNA hypo-

methylation of genes in immune pathways from PBMCs isolated from ME/CFS cases [18, 19]
and also in CD4+ T cells from ME/CFS cases [20]. Specifically, we found significant differences
in DNA methylation between ME/CFS cases and controls at 17,296 CpG sites in 6,368 genes
overall (FDR < 0.05), across promoters as well as other gene regulatory elements and within

coding regions of genes. DNA hypomethylation was found in 98% of these sites in ME/CFS,

whereas only 2% were hypermethylated compared to controls.

Differential methylation of promoters can have an effect on the expression of the corre-
sponding affected genes. Interestingly enough, less than half of the DMPs (47.6%) associated
with protein-coding genes while over 50% affected non-protein coding DMPs corresponding
to promoters of regulatory gene elements including short non-coding RNAs (including miR-
NAs, small nuclear RNAs, small nucleolar RNAs) (10.1%), long non-coding RNAs (including
antisense RNAs and intergenic RNAs) (30.6%), and pseudogenes (11.4%) (Fig 5). Small
nuclear RNAs and small nucleolar RNAs participate in RNA splicing [47] while long non-cod-
ing RNAs and pseudogenes play important roles in the regulation of transcription and MRNA
stability by annealing to transcripts and sequestering miRNAs as molecular sponges [48],
among other epigenetic mechanisms [49]. It is important to note that the highest beta differ-
ence (hypomethylation at 14%) in the DMP list was observed for the promoter of the gene that
is related to natural killer (NK) cells function (S6 and S7 Tables).

At the single gene level, our results showed hypomethylation of promoters of genes related
to those of reference studies such as some solute carriers, RNA binding proteins, homeobox,
and PHD finger proteins [20]. Among them we found the MED13L gene which is associated
with muscular hypotonia and neurocognitive impairment [50], symptoms that associate with
ME/CES. We also found DMPs linked to the expression of ribosomal proteins (RPL23A and
RPL7) as well as to the 5S ribosomal RNAs pseudogenes (RNA5SP245, RNA5SP77 and
RNASSP97) (S5 Table) suggesting possible disturbance of protein synthesis. In regards to the
methylation status of glucocorticoid response-associated genes, we found significant hypo-
methylation of the SGK3 (serum glucocorticoid regulated kinase) gene promoter [18, 19].

Transcriptional profiling studies in ME/CFS cases have pointed out perturbations in T-cell
and B-cell activation and dysregulation in gene expression broadly related to immune
responses [51-56], and such changes fit with other studies showing altered production of
interleukin and interferon cytokines as features of ME/CFS immune dysfunction [57]. In the
current study, we report hypomethylation of DMPs of genes known to regulate the adaptive
immune response such as immunoglobulins and pseudogenes (for example, IGDCC3,
IGHD7-27, IGHJ1, IGHJ3 and other) (S6 and S7 Tables) which is in agreement with the
reported improvement of ME/CFS cases following B cell depletion therapy [58, 59]. We also
observed hypomethylation of promoters of MMP14, MAP4K4, MAPK12 and CREBS5 (S6 and
S7 Tables) possibly activating the TNF signaling pathway, that fits with the reported over-

DNA methylation in ME/CFS

expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines [60] in ME/CFS. In addition, we also show hypo-
methylation of miRNA-148a promoter that could potentially contribute to its overexpression.
It is known that the miRNA-148-152 family can impair the innate immune response and anti-
gen presentation of TLR-triggered dendritic cells [61]. Furthermore, miRNA-148a can con-
tribute to DNA hypomethylation in lupus CD4+ T cells by repressing DNA methyltransferase
1 expression [62]. It is noteworthy to mention that amongst the DMPs associated to miRNA
expression in this study (S5 Table), miRNA-10a, miRNA-181 and miRNA-4710 were also
reported to be affected at the DNA methylation level in at least one previous ME/CFS study
[20]. Specifically, miRNA-10a has been associated with ME/CFS in NK cells [63] and miR-181
is related to TLR-mediated inflammatory response [64], which is associated with ME/CFS
[65].
Hypomethylation of the IL21R gene promoter (S6 and S7 Tables) may indicate increased

IL21 receptor expression. The ligand binding of this receptor leads to the activation of multiple
downstream signaling molecules, including JAK1, JAK3, STAT1, and STAT3. Knockout stud-
ies of the ortholog mouse counterpart suggest a role for this gene in regulating immunoglobu-

lin production [66]. IL21 regulates both innate and adaptive immune responses, and also

exerts major effects on inflammatory responses that promote the development of autoimmune
diseases and inflammatory disorders [67]. Importantly, IL21 signaling is critical for induction
of spontaneous experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis [68]. The DMPs reported in our
studies are not only consistent and validate the previous studies of gene regulatory elements in
genes within the immune cell regulation cluster [14-20], but also provide an improved under-
standing using advanced technology as well as validation using cohorts from distant geo-
graphic locations.

It is noteworthy to mention that it is still inconclusive from previous studies or our current
study, whether the significant epigenetic modifications found to associate with ME/CFS indi-
cate a compensatory homeostatic mechanism or result from an adaptive immune response
towards environmental inducers. However, these results indicate that DNA methylation con-
stitutes a potential gene regulatory mechanism capable of mediating long-term changes in
ME/CES cases, as previously noted by other authors [18-20]. In summary, the association of
differential DNA methylation with ME/CFS definitely suggests a potential role for epigenetic
alterations in the pathophysiology of ME/CFS.

5. Conclusions

To our knowledge, this is the first study that has explored genome-wide epigenetic changes
associated with ME/CFS using the new Illumina MethylationEPIC microarrays covering over
850,000 CpG sites and that has validated the results in two geographically distant cohorts of
ME/CFS cases. Our findings build on previous preliminary reports showing association of
altered methylation profiles of genes with immune functions and confirm DNA methylation
as an epigenetic regulatory mechanism associated with ME/CFS. Future validation studies in
larger cohorts of ME/CFS cases are needed to confirm these findings and evaluate the effects
of such methylation patterns on gene expression.

Abstract: Background and Objectives: Long COVID defines a series of chronic symptoms that patients
may experience after resolution of acute COVID-19. Early reports from studies with patients with
long COVID suggests a constellation of symptoms with similarities to another chronic medical
illness—myalgic encephalomyelitis/ chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). A review study comparing
and contrasting ME/CFS with reported symptoms of long COVID may yield mutualistic insight into
the characterization and management of both conditions. Materials and Methods: A systemic literature
search was conducted in MEDLINE and PsycInfo through to 31 January 2021 for studies related to
long COVID symptomatology. The literature search was conducted in accordance with PRISMA
methodology. Results: Twenty-one studies were included in the qualitative analysis. Long COVID
symptoms reported by the included studies were compared to a list of ME/CFS symptoms compiled
from multiple case definitions. Twenty-five out of 29 known ME/CFS symptoms were reported by at
least one selected long COVID study. Conclusions: Early studies into long COVID symptomatology
suggest many overlaps with clinical presentation of ME/CFS. The need for monitoring and treatment
for patients post-COVID is evident. Advancements and standardization of long COVID research
methodologies would improve the quality of future research, and may allow further investigations
into the similarities and differences between long COVID and ME/CFS.

1. Introduction

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a highly contagious respiratory disease caused
by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2), was declared a
pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020 [1]. As of 7 March 2021, there
are over 100 million cumulative cases, with over 2.5 million deaths worldwide [2]. Within
the United States alone, there have been almost 30 million cumulative cases, with over half
a million deaths as of mid-March [3].

In terms of clinical profile and disease symptomatology, individuals afflicted with
COVID-19 vary greatly in terms of clinical presentation [4,5]. While some individuals
remain asymptomatic, others experience symptoms generally associated with other viral
respiratory diseases, such as fever, cough, dyspnea, headache, and sore throat [6-8]. During
the acute phase of COVID-19, various other systemic impacts including gastrointestinal,
renal, hepatological, rheumatological, and neurological symptoms and complications have
been reported [9,10]. While there continues to be significant public concern and research
centered around the acute course and presentation of COVID-19, there is increasing public
and academic interest in the chronic sequelae of the disease [11-13].

There is currently no uniform terminology for this so-called long COVID [14], or, as it
has also been termed, long-haul COVID-19 [15,16], post-COVID syndrome [17], chronic

COVID syndrome [18], and more recently, post-acute sequelae of SARS-COV-2 infection
(PASC) [19]. There is no established case definition or diagnostic criteria, but some have
suggested long COVID as being defined by persistent signs and symptoms more than four
weeks after initial infection with SARS-COV-2 [20,21]. Research into the prevalence of long
COVID is ongoing, but one study has estimated that over 87% of COVID patients continue
to experience at least one symptom, two months after COVID symptom onset [22]. The
risk for developing long COVID does not appear to be correlated with the severity of acute
illness [23]. The etiologies of long COVID are uncertain, with some linking it to autoimmune
condition or hyperinflammatory states after resolution of acute COVID [24-26].

The characteristics and mysterious nature of long COVID led some to suggest a
connection to a debilitating but lesser-known chronic medical condition: myalgic en-
cephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) [27-29]. ME/CFS is a long-term
complicated illness characterized by at least six months of fatigue and exhaustion. This
illness is estimated to account for USD 18-51 billion dollars in economic costs. In total,
2.5 million Americans suffer from chronic fatigue syndrome, with one quarter of those
diagnosed being house or bed bound [30]. Within the general population, the prevalence of
chronic fatigue ranges between ten and forty percent. Despite this, due to a lack in diagnos-
tic testing without consistent and established treatments, there has been disputes regarding
the actual existence of chronic fatigue syndrome. As the diagnosis is mostly based upon
patient’s subjective feedback, this has sparked stigma that has led to dismissive behaviors
in the medical community. The misconception regarding chronic fatigue syndrome may
have been started because of how it was initially characterized. For example, early reports
of chronic fatigue were described as a derogatory term known as the Yuppie Flu, which
initially characterized the illness among young workers, with the implication of individuals
trying to get out of their job responsibilities. However, since this time, the illness has come
to be understood to rather affect a broader array of populations, but with a predominance
of women being more affected than men [31]. To better understand this illness, improved
knowledge of the research and definitions surrounding the illness is needed.

One of the most recent definitions of the illness was formed by the Institute of Medicine
in 2015 to avoid further stigma and to promote more knowledge of chronic fatigue syn-
drome. At that time, the illness was redefined as systemic exertion intolerance disease,
with criteria stating that a patient must have significant impairment in the ability to engage
in pre-illness levels of educational, occupational, personal, or social activities. This must be
due to fatigue that persists for more than 6 months, in addition to post-exertional malaise
and unrefreshing sleep, which are other key features of the illness. In addition, the criteria
state that a patient must have at least one of the following symptoms: orthostatic intoler-
ance or cognitive decline. As there may be a significant impairment in overall functioning,
symptoms should be present with moderate, substantial, or severe intensity with a high
frequency of occurrence. These symptoms in chronic fatigue syndrome have been shown
to have common onset factors and course. It has been found that during the initial duration
of the illness, the most common symptoms were fatigue, pain, cognitive and sleep changes,
and flu-related symptoms. As the illness progressed, other medical illnesses tended to
worsen the overall course, and few patients had full remission after years of struggle,
but rather remained disabled with functional impairments. The most common pattern of
onset was following an infectious event, which was followed by gradual progression to
consistent sickness. While there have been many theories on the causes of ME/CFS, the
three most common precipitating factors have been demonstrated to be infectious illness,
stress or major life event, and exposure to an environmental toxin [32]. Several studies
have shown that chronic fatigue syndrome patients also react to stressors in an abnormal
way, including an abnormal rise in serum cortisol and heart rate in response to the stress of
waking up [33].

Over the years, there have been various proposed models for the pathophysiology
of ME/CFS. One of the most prominent potential causes of chronic fatigue syndrome
includes infection with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), being highly studied in this setting. A

subset of severe chronic fatigue patients exhibit upregulation of EBV-induced gene 2, which
serves as a critical gene in immune and central nervous system function. Induction of this
gene by EBV could explain the variance of neurological and immune-related symptoms
encountered, which has been seen in 38-55% of patients with the illness and has been
associated with a variety of autoimmune diseases [34]. Studies have found many other
infectious organisms to be associated with chronic fatigue syndrome, including enterovirus,
cytomegalovirus, human herpesvirus-6, human parvovirus B19, hepatitis C, Chlamydophila
pneumoniae and Coxiella burnetii [35]. When considering an infectious cause, it will also be
important to determine how the human microbiome of persistent pathogens may drive
chronic symptoms by interfering with host metabolism, gene expression and immunity.
One example of this occurs as bacterial microbes modulate natural killer activity, which
has been shown to be reduced in chronic fatigue patients [36]. In terms of immunological
explanations, the most consistently reported are increased numbers of activated cytotoxic
CD8+T cells and poorly functioning natural killer cells, increased immune activation mark-
ers, greater numbers of CD16+/CD3- natural killer cells, and the presence of interferon
gamma in serum and cerebrospinal fluid [37]. Other etiologies may include metabolic and
endocrine abnormalities, where the body lacks energy and drive because the cells have a
problem generating and using energy from oxygen, sugars, lipids, and amino acids. In
terms of metabolism, studies have revealed that patients with chronic fatigue syndrome
have metabolites including sphingolipids and phospholipids that resemble a hibernation
state with significantly lower than normal levels [38].

There exists a large volume of research on the pathogenesis and management of
ME/CFS. If long COVID is demonstrated to be a similar chronic medical illness with
overlaps in clinical features and symptomatology, it may be conjectured that the existing
knowledge on ME/CFS may benefit patients of long COVID. Given the statistics on disease
prevalence reported by early studies into long COVID, millions of patients will stand to
benefit from insights into the treatment and management of their conditions. Conversely,
the increasing public interest in long COVID and an outpouring of research efforts into
this condition may yield additional research findings that can benefit patients suffering
from ME/CFS. There is an urgent need for studies on the similarities and differences of
the symptomatology and pathophysiology of long COVID and ME/CFS. To the authors’
knowledge, there has been no comparative review study into the clinical profiles of long
COVID and ME/CFS. Therefore, we conducted a systemic review of the research avail-
able thus far into the symptomatology of long COVID, and compared them with known
symptoms of ME/CFS based on multiple, widely accepted case definitions.

2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Search Strategy

We searched MEDLINE and PsyclInfo for articles with studies into clinical profiles and
symptoms of long COVID, published up to 31 January 2021. As noted in the introduction,
due to the lack of uniformed terminologies for long COVID, we used broad, general
search terms with the intention of capturing the widest possible array of articles in our
literature search.

For MEDLINE, we used the following search terms: (Long COVID) OR (long haul
covid) OR (Chronic COVID) OR (Post-COVID) OR ((“Coronavirus Infections /complications”
[Mesh]) AND “COVID-19” [Mesh] AND “Symptom Assessment” [Mesh]). For PsycInfo,
we used the following search terms: (Long COVID) OR (long haul covid) OR (Chronic
COVID) OR (Post-COVID). The titles and abstracts of the identified articles were reviewed,
and the full texts of the selected studies were further examined according to the eligibility
criteria. The search and review process are illustrated in Figure 1, following the PRISMA
guideline for systemic reviews [39].

2.3. Synthesis of Results

We performed qualitative compilation and analysis of data reported by the selected
studies. Research into the clinical profile and symptomatology of long COVID is still in
its infancy, and there is currently no established methodology or protocol for studying
patients with long COVID. Due to the heterogeneity in many aspects of the selected
studies, including study populations, data gathering methodologies, and study timelines,
a quantitative analysis of the data would be mistaken and inappropriate.

Another consequence of the heterogeneity of long COVID studies and the lack o:
uniform case definition of long COVID is that the selected studies utilize different termi
nologies for signs/symptoms that are similar or even identical. As part of the analysis
process of study data, we attempted to standardize the terminologies of findings and
symptoms by examining the methodologies and measurement methods as described by the
corresponding studies, and then further comparing those terminologies to those utilized
by ME/CFS case definitions. At times, certain findings and symptoms required further
research and interpretation for data analysis. One example would be the 6 min walking test
(6MWT) [40], an assessment tool that has been used previously in ME/CFS studies [41,42
and is classified under post-exertional malaise for the purpose of this study.

All long COVID symptoms reported by the selected studies are mapped onto a
comparison chart with known ME/CFS criteria. The ME/CFS criteria is adopted from a
study by Lim et al. [43] comparing known case definitions of ME/CFS. We selected this
compilation of ME/CFS case definitions for our analysis to capture the widest possible
array of known ME/CFS symptoms.

3. Results

Initially, a total of 5412 articles were identified through database searches through
MEDLINE and PsycInfo. After examining the titles and available abstracts of articles, and
removing duplicate articles, 140 articles remained. The full texts of the 140 articles were
examined and evaluated based on article type and content relevance, and distilled down
to 33 articles. The articles were further evaluated based on the eligibility criteria, and
21 articles were selected for the final analysis.

The included long COVID studies are shown in Table 1. The chart further specifies
the number of patients included in the studies, patient populations, location, median time
at the time of symptom assessment, methodology of assessment, key findings, and other
additional findings. The studies are ranked in the chart in descending order according to
the number of patients included. As noted in the methods section, the heterogeneity of
study methods meant the impracticality of quantitative analysis of the studies; the studies
are ranked in this order for the purpose of clarity and qualitative interpretations of the
studies. When applicable, the percentage of study patients experiencing long COVID
symptoms was provided with the key findings of each study.

The long COVID symptoms described by each study were mapped onto a comparison
chart between ME/CFS symptoms, matching long COVID symptoms, and unmatched
long COVID symptoms, as seen in Table 2. All except four ME/CFS symptoms (motor
disturbance, tinnitus /double vision, lymph node pain/tenderness, sensitivity to chemicals,
foods, medications, odors) were reported by at least one selected study on long COVID
symptoms. All three major criteria symptoms as specified by most ME/CFS case defini-
tions (fatigue, reduced daily activity, post-exertional malaise) were reported by multiple
selected long COVID studies, with fatigue being the most reported symptom (13 out of 21
eligible studies). All sub-categories within the minor criteria of ME/CFS (neurologic/pain,
neurocognitive / psychiatric, etc.) were matched with long-COVID studies. Only three se-
lected studies met the >6 months duration criteria for ME/CFS. There were a few reported
long COVID symptoms that were unique from ME/CFS symptoms, including olfactory
dysfunction, gustatory dysfunction, and rash.

4. Discussions

To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first review article to examine and compare
the symptoms of ME/CFS and long COVID. While there are notable findings when the
symptoms reported by the selected long COVID studies were juxtaposed with existing
ME/CFS case definitions, it is first worth discussing the quality and design of the selected
studies. Though COVID-19 has occupied the public consciousness since the early parts of
2020 [63-65], long COVID did not become a subject of public and academic interest until
the latter half of 2020, as evidenced by the publication date of the earliest long COVID
study included in our paper, July 2020 [22]. The majority of the included studies were
published at the end of 2020/beginning of 2021. The research into long COVID is still in
its infancy, though there have been ongoing calls for more research and funding into this
potentially devastating chronic medical condition [66-68].

For the purpose of this systemic review, the implications are such that there is no
uniform long COVID case definition, terminologies, and study methods, which leads to
a heterogeneity in the study data that precludes quantitative analysis. For one, there is
a huge disparity in terms of the timeline of studies, with the time of assessment rang-
ing from a month to 6 months after symptom onset. The studies also vary greatly in
assessment methodologies; while some studies utilized patient questionnaires (Goertz
et al. [44], Petersen et al. [48], etc.), others utilized in-person evaluations and assessment
tools (Townsend et al. [49], Ortelli et al. [56], etc.). Within individual studies, as the authors
of one of the studies pointed out, external validity of the studies may be limited due to
biases (Goertz et al. [44]). Yet, it is important to keep in mind that the presented studies in
this article represent some of the earliest research into symptoms of long COVID, and thus
they are hugely valuable in their research into long COVID symptomatology, as well as
their insight into future study designs and research protocol into long COVID.

In this systemic review study, the reported symptoms of long COVID from 21 selected
studies were compared to a compilation of ME/CFS symptoms from multiple case defini-
tions [43], including Institute of Medicine [69], Fukuda et al. [70], International Consensus
Criteria [71], and Canadian Consensus Criteria [72]. The results suggest a high degree of
similarities between long COVID and ME/CFS. Out of 29 listed ME/CFS symptoms, all
but 4 were reported by at least one long COVID study. It is particularly notable that all
three major criteria symptoms, namely fatigue, reduced daily activity, and post-exertional
malaise, were reported by multiple studies. Furthermore, fatigue was specifically noted in
12 of the 21 selected studies, which likely suggests fatigue as a predominant symptom of
patients suffering from long COVID.

Despite the findings from this comparison, it may be too early to establish a direc
causal relationship between long COVID and the development of ME/CFS. Specifically,
many of the patients described do not meet the criteria for ME/CFS due to limitations of
the studies in regard to duration of symptoms. The diagnosis of ME/CFS requires tha
the symptoms have been present for at least 6 months. Only three of the selected studies
involved the assessment of patients more than 6 months after the onset of their COVI
symptoms (Huang et al. [45], Taboada et al. [47], Ludvigsson [57]). The rest of the selecte
studies range from 37 days to 4 months. It is worthwhile pointing out that within thes
three studies, 63% of patients from one study reported fatigue (Huang et al. [45]) an
47.5% of patients from another reported decreased functional status (Taboada et al. [47
In other words, a significant number of patients continue to suffer from long COVI
symptoms after 6 months, seemingly at levels comparable to data from studies involving
shorter time courses. While the heterogeneity in the study populations and assessmen:
methods preclude meta-analysis of the patient data, it may be suggested that the long
COVID symptoms reported by patients in other shorter-duration studies may not resolve
completely by 6 months. It has previously been suggested that, even using conservative
methodologies, an estimated 10% of patients with COVID-19 may develop chronic illness
meeting the definition of ME/CFS [28]. With over 100 million cumulative COVID-19 cases

worldwide as of March 2021 [2], the disease burden of this ME/CFS-like chronic illness
will likely be devastating.

Aside from similarities in clinical features, long COVID and ME/CFS appear to have
certain commonalities in their pathophysiology. As noted in the introduction, the patho-
genesis of ME/CFS has been linked to multiple underlying processes including immune
system dysregulation, hyperinflammatory state, oxidative stress, and autoimmunity [73].
A particular phenotype of ME/CFS has been termed post-infectious fatigue syndrome, and
it has been linked to acute viral infections such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and human
parvovirus (HPV)-B19 [74,75]. While the etiology of long COVID is likely multifaceted
and the research is still ongoing, it has been similarly linked to inflammatory state and
dysregulated immune response [76,77], further underlying the resemblance between long
COVID and ME/CFS [78].

Some of the included studies in this review also attempted to characterize the un-
derlying pathophysiology of the long COVID symptoms, and the findings have been
mixed. Ortelli et al. [56] noted that their study patients exhibited markedly elevated serum
interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels, suggesting the role of hyperinflammation in the pathogenesis
of long COVID. However, Townsend et al. [51] did not find any correlation between the
patients’ fatigue severity and their serum level of inflammatory markers. Alhiyari et al. [61]
noted that the patient in their case report experienced a cough for at least 4 months, and
this is likely attributable to the development of pulmonary fibrosis post-COVID. Townsend
et al. [49], on the other hand, noted that only a small percentage of their study patients
developed pulmonary fibrosis and that this does not appear to be linked with their symp-
tom severity. Further research into the pathogenesis of long COVID and the correlation
between acute illness severity and subsequent long COVID symptoms is needed.

With the early research and studies suggesting, at least on certain levels, similarities
between the clinical presentation and etiologies of long COVID and ME/CFS, it would
be important to consider the implication in the treatment paradigms for both conditions.
It would appear that long COVID has so far avoided the earlier obscure fate of ME/CFS,
with an outpouring of public and expert acknowledgement for its status as a medical
illness and its significant long-term health impact [79-82]. Many have attested to the
importance of providing patient support and monitoring patients’ chronic symptoms
post-COVID, as well as the need for further research into long COVID [83-85]. Though
there is no established treatment protocol for patients with long COVID symptoms, many
have acknowledged and suggested the need and benefits of rehabilitation [86,87]. With the
consideration that long COVID and ME/CFS may share certain underlying pathological
processes, some have suggested that ME/CFS treatment modalities, such as antioxidant
therapies, may be beneficial for COVID symptoms [78,88]. In addition, as in the cases with
patients with ME/CFS, patients with long COVID may also benefit from developing an
energy management plan with a team of interdisciplinary physicians [89]. This may include
understanding the patients’ activity threshold and managing daily energy expenditure in
order to maintain a healthy active lifestyle while reducing symptom flare-ups. Looking
ahead to the future, it may be suggested that the research into long COVID and the ongoing
research into ME/CFS may have a symbiotic relationship, with advances made in each
medical illness being able to benefit patients suffering from long COVID and ME/CFS.

Limitations and Future Directions

The results of this review suggest many potential avenues for further exploration
and research. While this review provides a qualitative analysis of the similarities and
differences between symptoms of long COVID and ME/CFS, a quantitative analysis
further delineating the characteristics of both conditions would be warranted. Such an
analysis would require further research into the clinical presentation of long COVID, with
studies involving standardized methodologies. Investigations into the various contributing
factors to long COVID symptoms, including severity of acute disease, history of medical

illness, and patient demographics would be beneficial for a future review of ME/CFS and
long COVID.

5. Conclusions

This review represents the first investigation of its kind into the similarities between
symptoms of ME/CFS and long COVID. Based on data from early research into patients
suffering from long COVID, this review study suggests many overlaps in the clinical
presentation of long COVID and ME/CFS. Further studies into the pathogenesis and
symptomatology of long COVID are warranted. With the ever-increasing cumulative
cases of COVID-19 worldwide, and the tremendous number of patients who are currently
suffering from, or will eventually develop symptoms of long COVID, similar research into
long COVID and ME/CFS will be of paramount importance for years to come.

Long COVID (also termed Post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 [PASC]) refers to the
chronic symptoms that survivors may experience after severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and acute coronavirus disease
2019 (COVID-19) disease. Long COVID represents a global public health,
medical, and nursing challenge that affects millions of people. As an emerging
and evolving syndrome, long COVID manifests with many combinations of
clinical signs and symptoms that healthcare providers and scientists are
cataloging and struggling to understand. In this mini-review, we introduce the
epigenetic battlefield of DNA methylation (DNAm) on which the virus and the
host interact. We suggest ways in which DNAm phenomena and markers
induced by this virus-host interaction may help clarify the pathology and
prognosis of long COVID. Knowledge of DNAm characteristics of long COVID
patients is limited as of this writing (early-2024), investigators have noted both
the partial reversibility and the potential long-lasting persistence of the DNAm
markers induced by acute COVID-19. Long-term sequelae seen in other
coronavirus diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and
Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) are potential references for long
COVID in an effort towards more precise diagnosis and disease
characterization, better prediction of outcomes, and the use of epigenetic
phenomena towards development of new drugs and immunotherapies.

1 Introduction

Long COVID is also known as Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC), Post-acute
COVID-19 Syndrome, Post-COVID Conditions, among many other names. It refers to
long-term signs and symptoms that may persist or emerge in survivors of coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19). As of 2023, reliable biomarkers that indicate long COVID are
very limited, so the long-term symptoms that some people experience after their recovery
from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection are a
syndrome whose full pathogenicity and manifestations are unclear and under study. An
estimated 10%-20% of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections lead to long COVID (1).

Xiao and Vermund

Transient asymptomatic acute infection is far less likely to result in
long COVID compared to the higher risk among hospitalized and/
or unvaccinated COVID-19 patients (2).

Long COVID can be considered a disability under the
Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) when it substantially
limits one’s major life activities (3). An internet population-based
survey of 15,308 responders found that the presence of long COVID
is associated with a lower likelihood of working full-time (adjusted
OR, 0.84[95% CI, 0.74-0.96]) and a higher likelihood of being
unemployed (adjusted OR, 1.23[95% CI, 1.02-1.48]) (4).

The high degree of variability of symptoms and duration of long

COVID, the lack of biomarkers and diagnostic tests, and the protean
symptoms experienced by patients complicate our understanding of
the syndrome from both clinical and public health perspectives. The
most common symptoms include fatigue, low-grade fever, breathing
difficulty, difficulties in cognition or concentration, dizziness, loss of
smell or taste, and/or other symptoms of varying severity (5). A 2023
meta-analysis of 36 studies with 11,598 long COVID patients
summarized long COVID symptoms within five problem categories:
general, neurological, mental, cardiopulmonary, and gastrointestinal.
The symptoms with the highest pooled prevalence included fatigue
(29.2%), cognitive impairment (28.8%), joint pain (28.2%) and anxiety
(27.8%) (6). While these symptoms slowly improved for most people
with long COVID, they afflicted some patients for 2-3 years after their
SARS-CoV-2 infections in 2019-2021 (7). The pathophysiology of
these SARS-CoV-2 infection complications is thought to reflect
neuronal damage, immune dysregulation, disruption in the human
microbiota, microvascular blood clotting, and persistent viral
replication and/or immune stimulation from viral products (2, 8).
Multiple pathophysiological mechanisms may be involved in different
patients or even in a single patient.

The most effective prevention of long COVID is to avoid
infection altogether or to limit the severity of SARS-CoV-2
infection; immunization reduces the severity of symptoms and
probability of long COVID (7). But on behalf of people already
suffering from long COVID and those who will suffer symptomatic
COVID-19 in the future (e.g. those who are immunosuppressed,
aged, vaccine-hesitant, or lack vaccine access), a much better
understanding is needed of mechanisms and markers of long
COVID syndrome in all its manifestations. A 2023 systematic
review reported 113 biomarkers from 28 studies that were
significantly associated with long COVID, including cytokines/
chemokines (38 markers in total from 33.6% of the studies),
biochemical markers (24, 21.2%), and vascular markers (20, 17.7%)
(9). The strongest evidence points towards an upregulation of IL-6,
CRP, and TNF-a, all of which have potential as diagnostic
biomarkers for long COVID. However, the specificities of these
biomarkers are suboptimal for long COVID as they can be
triggered by inflammation caused by a wide range of stressors (9).

The field of epigenetics examines which genes are actively
expressed in specific tissues in different people at given times, and
what influences these genes to be so expressed. The gene expression
pattern within this dynamic molecular system may determine which
tissue, people, and times are more susceptible to expressions of long
COVID symptoms or signs. DNA methylation (DNAm) is one of the
most studied epigenetic characteristics (10). It typically involves the

addition of a methyl group at the 5-carbon position of a cytosine base
followed by a guanine base in DNA molecules and plays an important
role in gene regulation (11). Molecular level studies of DNAm may
help explain the variable symptoms and potentially complex
pathophysiological mechanisms that are not yet well understood. In
this mini-review, we examine the long COVID through the prism of
DNAm and summarize the potential contributions of DNAm pattern
alterations and other epigenetic modifications that have been seen in
some long COVID patients.

2 DNAm dysregulation in acute
SARS-CoV-2 infection

As is the case for a host of diseases, epigenetic phenomena
influence COVID-19 progression. Cells employ epigenetic
modifications to regulate gene expression to combat the viruses,
while the viruses evade our immune response and promote
replication with analogous mechanisms (12). With DNA
methylation sequencing, ATAC-seq profiling, and other epigenetic
techniques, several key pathways in SARS-CoV-2 infection have
been suggested.

The angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), encoded by the
ACE2 gene, is located at the cell membrane in many organs and
tissues. Interaction of the host ACE2 protein and the spike protein
on the SARS-CoV-2 viral envelope is key to initiation of viral entry
(Figure 1). A higher probability of developing severe symptoms of
COVID-19 was noted with higher expression levels of ACE2 in the
lung among patients with comorbidities early in the pandemic (14).
However, a clear causal relationship between a higher level of ACE2
on the cell membrane and worse disease prognosis has not been
established; ACE2 functions in multiple pathways, and its influence
is affected by other factors such as sex hormones and histone
modification (15).

In contrast, Ni et al. have proposed that decreased levels of
ACE2 may also have adverse prognostic effects. Through viral entry,
the ACE2 protein is internalized with the virus, resulting in a
decrease in cell surface ACE2 expression and an imbalance in the
renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) (16). RAAS
imbalance can contribute to exacerbation of COVID-19 disease.

Several epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) have
identified DNAm patterns associated with COVID-19. Through
genome-wide DNA methylation profiling of mononuclear cells in
the blood of severe COVID-19 patients, a distinct DNAm pattern
was discovered by Corley et al. in which an increase in methylation
of interferon (IFN)-related genes, including IFITM1 and ISG20, as
well as of ACE2, and decrease in methylation of inflammatory and
cytokine genes, including MX1 were seen (17). The investigators
also found an increase in epigenetic age acceleration among severe
COVID-19 patients. Hence, SARS-CoV-2 can suppress a host’s
antiviral response, stimulate a cytokine-driven inflammatory storm,
and perturb the host’s epigenome.

CpG sites are regions of a cytosine nucleotide followed by a
guanine nucleotide in the DNA’s linear base sequence (in the 5 to 3
prime direction). CpG sites and islands (with high CpG frequency)
are implicated in a wide array of genetically influenced phenomena,

Lower methylation level of the CpG islands in the DNA promoter sequence increases the expression level of ACE2 and interferon genes, which may
lead to higher susceptivity to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and may influence risk of long COVID. From Pruimboom L, 2020 (13).

including aging and cancer, gene methylation, and gene silencing.
With a customized Infinium MethylationEPIC® array (Illumina
Inc., San Diego, CA, USA), Konigsberg et al. found 13,033 genome-
wide significant CpG sites which were significantly different
between the 164 COVID-19 cases and 296 uninfected controls.
Among these CpG sites, genes and pathways involved in interferon
signaling and viral response were significantly enriched. The
authors also constructed machine learning models that predicted
case-control status (area under the receiver-operator characteristic
curve [AUC], 93.6%) and also predicted clinical outcomes such as
hospitalization (AUC, 79.1%), intensive care unit (ICU) admission
(AUC, 80.8%), and progression to death (AUC, 84.4%) (18).
Using similar techniques, Castro et al. discovered 44 CpG sites
that were differentially methylated comparing 194 mild COVID-19
cases with 213 severe cases that required respiratory support. The

genes that these loci mapped to were mainly involved in interferon
responses to viral infection. A machine learning-based model
named EPICOVID was developed using these loci and predicted
COVID-19 disease severity with great accuracy (AUC, 92.1%) (19).

In 2021, Balnis et al. published results from a prospective cohort
study that looked at the DNAm profile of blood samples from 124
hospitalized patients and 39 healthy controls. All 124 patients had

moderate to severe respiratory failure, while 100 had positive SARS-

CoV-2 infection test results and 24 were tested negative. By
comparing the DNAm profile of COVID-19 patients with healthy
controls, and COVID-19 patients with non-COVID-19 patients, the
authors discovered 1,505 and 254 differentially methylated regions
(DMR) which were mapped to 1.680 and 230 unique genes
respectively. This suggests that the DNAm profile of COVID-19
patients can be distinguished from that of patients who have
respiratory failure due to other causes. Between these two
comparisons, 47 genes were overlapped, which were involved in
viral defense according to the ontology analysis (20). Together, these
studies have shown that acute SARS-CoV-2 infection can be
characterized by changes in the DNAm profile when compared
with either uninfected controls or patients who have respiratory
symptoms due to other causes. The loci involved have been integrated
into machine learning models that predict COVID-19 disease
outcome with great accuracy, suggesting high prognostic value.

Frontiers in Virology

While most studies on DNAm of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection
to date have focused on the severe stage of the infection, compared
to uninfected control subjects, studies of mild or asymptomatic
infections may have quite different epigenetic profiles. One EWAS
examined as cases those persons who tested positive for SARS-CoV-
2 by RT-PCR but had no symptoms compared to controls who were
COVID-19 symptomatic patients; a particular DNAm profile in
infected individuals was associated with an absence of symptoms
(21). A dose-response relationship may exist between the severity of
symptoms and the magnitude of dysregulation in the epigenetic
profile in SARS-CoV-2 infection.

3 DNAm characteristics in long
COVID patients

Only a few published studies are focused on DNAm in long
COVID patients through mid-2023, possibly because of the limited
time of follow-up (with first cases noted in December 2019) and
high cost of DNA methylation profiling techniques. Preliminary
results from Balnis et al. (22) suggest that epigenetic changes in
circulating leucocytes induced by COVID-19 can persist for at least
a year; epigenetic markers of long COVID align to some degree with
those seen during acute COVID-19.

EWAS was deployed in a subpopulation of 172 subjects of the
Norwegian Corona Cohort Study; 46 had mild COVID-19 cases, 58
were severe, and 68 were asymptomatic, serologically negative
controls. Forty-one (39.4%) (9 mild and 32 severe) cases among
104 COVID-19 subjects self-reported worse health conditions at the
time of the survey compared to a year before. They were designated
the long COVID group, comparing their epigenetic profiles with the
63 (60.6%) persons who had improved (the remission group).
While no statistically significant differences of methylation levels
at CpGs were found between the long COVID group and the
remission group in the EWAS study, two other significant DMRs

were found (23). The authors owed this lack of association to the
small sample size; we speculate that the pooled sample of mild and
severe cases and a self-reported definition of feeling worse after a
year might introduce misclassifications and diminish statistical

frontiersin.org

Xiao and Vermund

power to detect associations. Still, the Norwegian study was the first
and largest to examine DNAm markers of long COVID.

In a similar case-control setting but with 3 arms, Nikesjé et al.
(24) addressed the question of whether long COVID is associated
with epigenetic changes. The DNAm profiles of 10 subjects with
persistent and various long COVID symptoms, 14 COVID-19
convalescents (CC19) presented with mild or asymptotic initial
infections and 18 non-infected controls (Con) were compared. The
investigators found 197 differentially methylated CpGs (DMC)
between the PASC and CC19 groups, and 98 between PASC and
Con groups. It was interesting to note that seven subjects from the
PASC group were vaccinated but none from the CC19 group or Con
group were vaccinated. It is possible that some of the 197 DMCs
found between the PASC and CC19 groups determined the
vulnerability to long COVID, which saw a larger difference
between these two groups than between the PASC and Con
groups. The 271 DMCs were mapped to their corresponding genes
and 38 of these differentially methylated genes (DMG) were known to
encode proteins that are exploited by SARS-CoV-2. The most
pronounced difference between the PASC and CC19 groups was
seen in the SNORD3B gene, which encodes a small nucleolar RNA
that has been suggested to be exploited by viruses for infectivity (25).

Cao et al. (26) noted epigenetic aging acceleration and telomere
attrition in both mild and severe COVID-19 cases for 4 of the 5
epigenetic clocks examined, using peripheral blood samples, similar
to findings of Corley et al. (17). Longitudinal DNA methylation
profiling analysis noted partial reversal of these findings in later
clinical stages in some of the subjects (26). This observation is not
robust, however, as patient numbers were small and no association
between the epigenetic aging reversal and COVID-19 symptom
remission was noted.

In another small study, Yin et al. (27) employed whole-genome
bisulfite sequencing to identify DNAm markers in recovered mil
or moderate COVID-19 patients three months after discharge using
peripheral blood samples. There were nine cases and five age- an
gender-matched healthy controls. All the cases and controls were
Chinese males. They found 18,516 DMRs between the recovery an
the healthy group, 13,233 of which were within TE loci. Gene
ontology analysis revealed that the genes affected by these DMRs
were involved in signaling pathways, immune responses, an
metabolism. However, the reliability of these results can
potentially be undermined by the small sample size, biase

gender distribution, and cell type heterogeneity.

DNAm profiles are known to be a key to formation of long-
lasting memory in memory T and B cells. Differences in the DNAm
profiles between acute COVID-19 and long COVID may be foun
in these immune cells. Drugs that target epigenetic pathways may

help maintain immune homeostasis or even boost functional
COVID-19 vaccine responses (15).

During the recovery period from COVID-19, it is possible that
DNAm markers directly induced by the virus in the initial phase of
the disease are gradually replaced by the host-driven DNAm
markers for viral response and immune memory. This could be a
potential mechanism behind the partial restoration of normal
epigenetic profile and epigenetic aging reversal reported by Balnis
et al. (22) and Cao et al. (26). Cao et al. suggest that COVID-19

Frontiers in Virology

10.3389/fviro.2024.1371683

appears to leave irreversible ‘epigenetic scars’ that may mark the
presence of long COVID on a molecular level, suggesting a future
diagnostic strategy for at least a subset of long COVID sufferers.

4 Long term DNAm changes in other
coronavirus infections

Coronaviruses are a family of positive sense RNA viruses with a
genome size between 26 and 32 kb. SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh
member of the family documented to have infected humans,
including four mild respiratory disease viruses, severe acute
respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and
Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus (MERS-
CoV) (28). Despite being less lethal than the SARS-CoV and MERS-
CoV viruses, the SARS-CoV-2 has been more infectious and shares
with its predecessors the ability to kill its hosts and to cause chronic
symptoms in survivors, including fatigue and breathing difficulties.
Among SARS survivors, shortness of breath, fatigue, residual
radiological lung lesions, impaired perfusion to the lungs,
myalgias, and mental health problems have been observed during

follow-up periods ranging from 3 months to 15 years (29).
Comparing survivors of the three serious 3 viruses at both

biological and clinical level can hel)
long COVID.
Early in 1995, Sawicki et al. reported that chronic infection of

our understanding of

the murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) in a murine
cell line, 17C1-1, was associated with the epigenetic expression of
MHYV receptor glycoproteins. The cells that expressed the MHV
receptor were selectively eliminated by MHV, while the non-
expressing cells survived and proliferated. The chronic infection
persisted after over 400 passages over 3 years (30). Appropriate
animal models can help to study mechanisms of persistent SARS-
CoV-2 symptoms in long COVID patients.

Via a proteomic and epigenetic approach, Menachery et al.
investigated the host factors that are crucial in disease outcomes in
both influenza virus and coronavirus infections in human airway
epithelial cells (31). A down-regulation of gene expression related
resentation was seen in MERS-CoV infection but not

with antigen
in SARS-CoV infection. The investigators also suggested that
DNAm was the main driver for this antagonism to efficient
antigen presentation (31). A similar effect is seen in HEK293T
cells infected by SARS-CoV-2 (32). As reported by Zhang et al., the
ORF8 protein encoded by the SARS-CoV-2 genome physically
interacts with major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I),
leading to the selective degradation of MHC-I (32). This impairs the
antigen presentation system in the host cells and helps the virus
evade immune surveillance (32). Similarly, at the transcriptional
level, the genes in the MHC-II pathway are reported to be
downregulated in non-classical monocytes among convalescent
COVID-19 individuals (33). Acknowledging differences in
mechanisms that may underlie interference of host antigen
presentation, the study of COVID-19 prognosis may yield new
insights (34) and can benefit from the study of long-term
symptomatic survivors of SARS and MERS.

Xiao and Vermund

We have found no observational studies of human survivors
from SARS or MERS that focus on the epigenetic markers of
chronic symptoms. Epigenetics is an emerging field and the first
whole genome DNA methylation profiling was not completed until
2008 in Arabidopsis thaliana. Scientists who investigated the long-
term symptoms following SARS likely were not equipped with the
essential epigenetic techniques to address epigenetics scientific
questions; MERS cases numbered just 2605 from April 2012-
August 2023 with a 36% mortality rate (35). Today, DNA
methylation techniques are more accessible than ever for
COVID-19 research, which makes observational studies of DNA
methylation in humans feasible.

5 Summary

In summary, long COVID has protean manifestations, and its
study may reveal pathogenic features relevant to many other viruses
(2). Epigenetics, particularly DNA methylation, may play a central
role in determining whether long COVID will occur in a surviving
COVID-19 patient. DNAm profiles may be able to predict the
type of long COVID symptoms with
clinically significant prognostic value. Prior EWAS research focus
has been on the acute phase of COVID-19. In acute infection, the
host anti-viral response may be suppressed with a cytokine-driven

occurrence, severity, an

inflammatory storm, leading to accelerated epigenetic aging and a
perturbed methylome. Preliminary results have shown that a
portion of the DNAm markers featured in this disturbance can be
restored, while others persist for months or even longer. Although
few DNAm markers for long COVID have been identified to date,
there are promising candidates found among the family of

irreversible DNAm markers. Future research is recommended in
these areas, at least. (1) Large scale EWAS of diverse samples of long
COVID patients that have sufficient statistical power and can yield
clinically meaningful results that are generalizable to a wider
population; (2) Studies that specifically examine the interaction
between vaccination and prior infection history status correlated to
DNAm profiles to reveal how DNAm may mediate these factors

COVID EWAS to seek more valid epigenetic characterizations of
long COVID and insights into key subgroups. We welcome other
suggestions in this search for DNAm and key epigenetics insights as
to the etiologies and potential mitigations of both long COVID as
well as long-term consequences of a host of viral infections with
analogous post-viral syndromes.
