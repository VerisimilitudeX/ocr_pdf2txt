Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syn- drome (ME/CFS) is a chronic disease present- ing with severe fatigue, post-exertional malaise, and cognitive disturbances. Epigenetic studies in ME/C FS collectively confirm alterations and/or malfunctions in cellular and organismal physiol- ogy associated with immune responses, cellular metabolism, cell death and proliferation. Multiple viral infections have long been implicated in the onset and chronicity of ME/CFS pathol- ogy, but no single pathogen has been identified. Her- pesviruses are common infectious agents that establish life-long latency in humans. Sporadic reactivation of her-pesviruses facilitates transmission to uninfected individuals. 14 studies have examined alterations in DNAm profile in patients with ME/CFS. Most studies on DNAm patterns suggest alter- ations in immune responses. Corre- lations of DNAm pattern with symptom sever- ity (and particularly PEM) have been documented.

Four main categories: immunological abnormalities that manifest as persistent immune activation and exhaustion, with deregulated production of cytokines. Central and autonomic nervous system abnormalities that encompass hypothalamic pituitary axis (HPA) deregulation. Epigenetic changes in myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) from the analysis of DNA methylation profiles and the expression of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) These changes are illustrated along with the proposed downstream effects and functional mechanisms. These include (A) immune system abnormalities, (B) CNS (central) and ANS (autonomic) nervous system abnormalities. (C) impaired cellular metabolism and mitochondrial dysfunction Eleven studies have investigated the expression levels of ncRNAs in ME/CFS (Table 2) Most of them focused on the investigation of circulating 102 ncRNA levels in cerebrospinal fluid. Alterations in miRNA expression in CSF following exercise were related to cleavage of amyloids, apoptosis, and trans-endothelial migration. Long ncRNAs (IncRNAs) constitute nearly 68% of the transcriptome. They were suggested to have a significant regulatory role in antiviral interferon (IFN) response, viral transcription, and latency. Analysis of a selected panel of very long ncR- NAs in PBMCs could differentiate ME/CFS from healthy donors. EBV DNA in virions is “epigenetically naive,” but following infec- tion, EBV maintains its genome in the host cell as an extrachromosomal circular episome. Epigenetic silencing of viral DNA may have origi- nally evolved as an innate antiviral defense mech- anism that EBV successfully subverted. EBV infection triggers a cascade of events that collectively induce the expression of both viral and host ncRNAs. EBV-encoded small RNAs (EBERs) and right- ward transcripts from the Bam HIA region (BARTs) The BART 104 © 2024 The Journal of Internal Medicine published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd. Viral proteins and nucleic acids can disrupt metabolic pathways, leading to altered energy pro- duction. Alterations in cellular metabolism are dynamically integrated into the regulation of epigenetic mech- anisms and ensuing gene transcription. A typical infection triggers immune activation that is characterized by a metabolic shift toward glycolysis. Herpesviruses can acquire epigenetic control of their own genomes, but they also alter the epigenetic landscape of the host immune cells. Chronic/Recurrent viral infec- tion may stand as a long-term driving force for epi- genetic reprograming, which ultimately may lead to immune cell exhaustion. The clinical overlap between ME/CFS and long COVID stresses the role of viral infections in ME/ CFS initiation and chronicity. The etiology of long. COVID, which can be confidently attributed to SARS-CoV-2 infection, further consolidates the role. of viruses in the pathogenesis of post-viral fatigue syndromes. Me/CFS arises from an underly- ing genetic predisposition combined with environ- mental triggers that disrupt the patient’s health baseline. Virally induced epigenetic changes may persist in the absence of continued viral triggers. Epigenetic mechanisms are imperative in deter- mining the outcome of host-virus interactions. Epigenetic studies could be a key parameter in patient subtyping, facilitating the determination of the appropriate interventions. Currently, there is no standard treatment for ME/CFS patients. A few treatment approaches, either in clinical trials or off-label ther- apies, have shown encouraging results and sig- nificant improvement. Distinct plasma immune signatures in ME/CFS are present early in the course of illness. Cytokine signature associated with disease severity in chronic fatigue syndrome patients. Whole blood gene expression suggesting altered cell differentiation and survival suggesting altered B cell expression. Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a long-term condition that affects up to 10% of the U.S. population. CFS has been linked to increased risk of heart disease, stroke, depression, and even suicide. The National Institutes of Health has published a report on the link between CFS and the risk of cardiovascular disease. The Journal of Internal Medicine, 2024, 296; 93-115 joysduy wosy papeowumoq.

SARS-CoV-2 and COVID share similar symptoms and biological abnormalities. COVID patients have a higher risk of developing cancer than those who do not have the disease. The immune system is more sensitive to SARS than it is to other infections. Study on the immune cell proteome of long COVID patients shows changes to physiological pathways similar to those in myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome.

Journal of Internal Medicine, 2024, 296; 93-115. 15 participants hospitalized for SARS-CoV-2 infection were epityped one year after discharge. 71 regions with persisted differentially meth- ylated, with an average of 7 serial CpG positions per DMR. Sixty-four DMRs persisted hypermethylated, and 7 DMR persisted hypomethylated. We found that SARS-CoV-2 infection is characterized by 1505 DMRs compared to healthy con- trol individuals. Gene ontological analysis indicates that these genes participate in immune responses, leu- kocyte activation, viral responses, and related processes. We reasoned that a subset of these SARS.-Cov-2 D MRs could endure long after recovery from COVID-19. To investigate this hypothesis, all the participants from our original cohort who To prevent DNA methylation changes caused by asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, samples were taken from healthy volunteers enrolled in 2017, who were not recalled. Results indicate that 71 DNA regions persist differentially methylated one year after hospital discharge. Over 90 % of the lasting DMRs were located near or within gene promoter regions, suggesting an effect on gene expression regu- lation. Results indicate that the observed DMRs occur in genes that participate in process such as response to virus, regulation of immune processes and others. Critically ill patients have altered circulating blood DNA methylation consistent with epigenetic regulation of gene expres- sion. Many patients who survive COVID-19 develop long-term cog- nitive and somatic dysfunctions. We present here evidence that epigenetic marks can persist beyond clinical resolution of acute ill- ness. DNA methylation may be a mechanism regulating leukocyte adhesion and vascu- lar injury. The authors declare no conflicts of interest related to the manuscript content. The epigenotype is essential for regulatory development and stability of suppressive cell function. DNA methylation is a targeted gene-editing tool for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. Epigenetic clocks have been shown to be valuable tools for measuring biological age in various tissues and samples. These epigenetic clocks can determine accelerated biological aging and time-to-mor- tality across various tissues. The effect of accelerated epigenetic aging on outcome (death/recov- ery) in COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has not been well investigated. EAA and telomere attrition acceleration were associated with treatment outcomes in hospital- ized COVID-19 patients with ARDS. We detected higher EAA using both the Horvath and PhenoAge clocks in deceased ver- sus recovered patients. We observed epigenetic age deceleration at inclusion versus end of follow-up in recovered but not in deceased CO VID-19 cases using certain clocks. Chronological age is one of the well-established prognostic factors in patients with COVID-19 inde- pendent of other age-related comorbidities. SARS-CoV-2 genomic mutations in both untranslated regions and gene regions were also reported to be associated with increased risk for severe symptoms. Epigenetic age acceleration has been associated with multiple diseases including cancer, diabetes, Alzheimer’s disease, HIV infection, and certain progeroid Study aimed to comprehensively examine epi- genetic age acceleration in COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and how it relates to outcome (survival or death) following hospi- talization. Epigenetic age acceleration (EAA) was calculated using several clocks including Horvath, Han- num, DNAm skin and blood, GrimAge, and PhenoAge clocks. We measured EAA in the COVID-19 patients who recovered after being admitted to the ICU. Patients who died were on average older compared to those who recovered. In addition, they had a lower BMI, and were more likely to have hypertension and chronic kidney disease. Diabetes status Non diabetes 34 (50%) 12 (63.2%) = Pre-diabetes 2 (3%) 1 (5.3%) = Diabetes 32 (47%) 6 (31.6%) - Hypertension 29 (42.9%) 9 (47.4%) - Coronary artery disease 4 (5-5.9) - Chronic kidney failure 5 (7-4%) 2 (10.5%) = Chronic heart failure 1 (1.5 Epigenetic age acceleration was measured using six epigenetic clocks in the peripheral blood from 50 surviving versus 14 deceased COVID-19 patients at the end of follow-up. Overall, we observed an increased EAA in critically ill patients compared to non-infected controls. EAA was detected using one of the first-generation clocks (Hannum clock) as well as the second- generation clocks (PhenoAge and GrimAge) The study used multiple epigenetic clocks including first- and second-generation clocks and looked at a large cohort of 194 patients with mild/moderate symptoms and 213 severe COVID-19 patients. Patients who died after ICU admission did not show any differences in epige- netic aging at inclusion to the last recorded DNAm age before death. This indicates that CO VID-19 alters epi- genetic aging and decelerating this EAA would lead to recovery. We could not iden- tify differences in telomere attrition between COVID-19 patients and controls, which is in contrary to other stud- ies reporting telomeres shortening following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Similar to our study, Cao et al. used the DNAmTL surrogate marker to measure telomer length. Mongelli et. al. employed a qPCR-based assay for absolute telitere length quantification. The Bejaoui et al. could only determine an association between accelerated epigenetic aging and COVID-19. understanding the causal relationship between them was outside the scope of the current study. Future studies are required to explore whether epigenetic age acceleration is causally linked to disease severity and clinical outcome. The methylation B value for each CpG site was extracted and used as input to calculate the epigenetic age using various clocks. DNAm age was estimated using various epigenetic clocks such as the Horvath pan-tissue [18], PhenoAge [19], GrimAge [20], and SkinandBlood [41] DNAmTL was estimated where the deviation between DNAm TL and chronological age is defined as DNA mTL attrition acceleration. Epigenetic age acceleration The study is part of the “Immune Profiling of COVID-19 patients Admit- ted to ICU study (IMPROVISE) (clinicaltrial.gov identifier NCT0447313) The Institutional Review Board at HMC and Cornell approved the study with record numbers MRC-05-007 and 20-00012.

DNA methylation-based measures of biological age: meta-analysis predicting time to death. Study showed that epigenetic drift and age acceleration are associated with severe prognosis. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus was identified in Wuhan, China, in late 2019. COVID-19 has a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations, with most infected subjects showing only mild symptoms or being asymptomatic. There is an unmet medical need to discover endogenous cellular and molecular biomarkers that pre- dict the expected clinical course of the disease. There is a lack of knowledge regarding the role of epigenetics in characterizing severe outcomes in this specific patient group. We conducted a genome-wide study using the Illumina 850 K Beadchip on 190 blood samples from Italian COVID-19 patients who were at high risk for comorbidities and clinical fac- tors. The goal of this study was to identify epigenetic bio- markers that could predict the clinical prognosis of these patients. Calzari et al. (2023) European Journal of Medical Research 28:81 Page 3 of 15 Table 1 Classification of clinical characteristics of the COVID-19 cohorts.

The first principal component (PC1) captured a high ercentage of variation (35.4%) and was able to distin- guish the two groups showing a significant association with severity (OR=2.55) The results showed that the epi-signature was still able to distinguish between patients Epigenetic drift was investigated by analyzing the bur- den of Stochastic Epigenetic Mutations (SEMs) SEMs were defined as an extreme outlier in the distribution of DNA methylation values across individuals. To identify SEMs, the distribution and variability of methylation levels were first studied in con- trol populations. The burden of SEMs in the severe group was found to be statistically higher than in the mild group. Fisher’s method was then used to analyze the combined results of all three studies and assess their overall statistical significance. The impact of epigenetic drift was studied in more detail by dividing the SEMs into those that were hyper- methylated andThose that were hypomethylated. The trend of differences between the groups was still evident in the lists of hypermethylated SEMs, but statistical dif- ferences were mainly found in the Lists of hypometHyl The differential methylation analysis at the group level took into account cellular heterogeneity or confound- ers. It highlighted 880 differentially methylated CpG sites equally constituted by hyper- and hypo-methylation. It pointed out several potentially relevant genes involved in biological processes/pathways related to immune response and already implicated in COVID-19 response. The 880 CpG sig- nature was unable to distinguish all severe COVID-19 atients from mild subjects after unsupervised clustering. A subgroup (G4), strongly enriched in severe atients, clearly emerged. The logistic regression analysis showed a significant association between PC1 scores and severe outcomes [OR=2.55 (95% CI 1.9-3.5)]. The regression model took into account important covariates such as clinical factors and pharmac The grimage clock, the epigenetic signature associated with important mortality risk factors, was better at predicting survival than the risk factors themselves. When evaluating epigenetic markers used to esti- mate the biological age, we observed a significantly increased epigenetic age acceleration (DNAm GrimAge) This increase occurs even if no appreciable differences in patients’ chronological age between the two groups were observed. Severe COVID-19 patients show a higher burden of SEMs than their mild counterparts, especially hypo-methylations. Results indicate an association between host epigenet- ics and the progression of the disease. This information may be useful for personalized, timely, and targeted treat- ment. The severity of the disease outcome was determined by evaluating the clinical evolution of COVID-19 patients. 66 subjects who developed a negative evolution (admitted to intensive care unit or dead) were classified as “severe” cases. 124 patients with a less inauspicious clinical course (discharge at home or in other facilities with lower intensity) were assigned to the “mild” group. Only good-quality genomic DNA was used as input for bisulfite conversion. DNA methylation measures were also used to predict bio- logical age using different approaches including the pan tissue epigenetic clock by Horvath or DNAm-based bio- marker of mortality “DNAm GrimAge” The number of SEMs correlates with several events such as aging, X chromosome inactivation skewing in women, hepatocellular carcinoma tumor staging, unhealthy expo- sure such as cigarette smoking. SEMs have been recognized as possi- ble biomarkers of exposure-related accumulation of DNA damage during lifespan. Quality con- trol, pre-processing, and generation of the /-values dataset was performed using the ChAMP R package. Sites with a detection p-value above 0.01 and a bead count <3 in at least 5% of samples were filtered out. Sam- ples with an aberrant number of SEMs were also dis- carded. The Generalized Linear Regression (glm) model was adopted. The study was supported by two grants from the Italian Ministry of Health. The authors declare no conflicts of interest.

The existence of long-COVID, or post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), suggests potential long-term changes. Epigenetic patterns, accelerated biological aging, and enhanced epigenetic drift detected 6 months following COVID-19 infection: insights from a genome-wide DNA methylation study. SEM analysis identi- fied 790 affected genes, indicating dysregulation in pathways related to insulin resistance, VEGF signaling, apoptosis, hypoxia response, T-cell activation, and endothelin signaling. Results suggest possible associations with accelerated aging, epigenetic drift, and disruption of critical biological pathways. Understanding these epigenetic changes could be cru- cial for elucidating the complex mechanisms behind long-COVID. SARS-Cov-2 can reach (via hematogenous spreading) and infect cells of the central nervous system (CNS), pro- ducing neuroinflammation. The exact causes of long-COVID are still being inves- tigated, but some hypotheses have emerged over time. The possibility that these dysfunctions are medi- ated over time by epigenetic changes has been explored. We present a genome-wide study using the Illu- mina The analy- sis showed no significant differences in immune cell composition. At the site level, the study revealed a set of 42 CpG sites overlapping 53 genes exhibiting signifi- cant differential methylation between the two groups (FDR<0.05): 24 hypo-methylated (log2FC<0; AB<0) and 18 hyper- methylated ( log2FC > 0; Af > 0) (Fig. 2) Genomic localization of the Top-rated genes to note: GLUD1 (glutamate dehydrogenase 1) (cg00167275; log2FC=1.5), ATP1A3 (alpha 3 subunit of the Na+/K+ATPase), RNASEH2C (C sub unit of ribonuclease H), SMAD2 (SMAD family member 2) and ARRB2 (arrestin beta 2) Among the top 200 nominally The 13 genes associated to the 13 CpG sites are (in order of significance): DYRK2 (dual-specificity tyros- ine phosphorylation-regulated kinase 2), ATP5PF (ATP synthase peripheral stalk subunit F6), B4GAT1 (beta- 1,4-glucuronyltransferase 1), PRKXP1 (PRKX Pseudo- gene 1), SLC25A21 The role of DNA methylation in developing long-term COVID-19 symptoms has been examined in three pre- viously published studies. This study aimed to investigate potential epigenetic changes 6 months after exposure. We examined peripheral blood samples collected from SARS-CoV-2 patients. No discern- ible variance in the immune system landscape between the two groups, as evidenced by comparable estimates of blood cellular composition (CD8T, CD4T, NK, Bcell, Mono, Gran) (Supplementary File 8) No significant differences in the various cell types under consideration. No difference in DNA methylation at CpG sites and regions. Mutations in the C subunit of ribonuclease H (RNASEH2C), ‘or example, have been reported to affect the immune response and potentially result in severe COVID-19 out- comes. SMAD2 (SMAD family member 2) is a rotein that plays a role in the TGF-£ signaling pathway, which is involved in the regulation of cell growth, dif- erentiation, and immune response. TNFAIP SARS-CoV-2 infection induces Golgi fragmentation, which aids in viral trafficking and release. Calzari et al. identified 13 genes showing notably consistent epige- netic differences among studies. Telomere shortening is a widely observed and confirmed aspect in the context of COVID-19. To assess epigenetic drift at the gene level (Gene-EML), we employed a sequence kernel associa- tion test (SKAT) Designed initially for rare variant stud- ies, this method has recently found applications in other areas like copy number variations (CNVs) and epigenetic modifications. The "VEGF signaling pathway" and "Hypoxia response via HIF activation" pathways have been associated with COVID-19 due to their involvement in vascular dys func These results provide comprehensive insights into the epigenetic consequences of SARS- CoV-2 exposure after 6 months. We emphasize, for completeness of information, that an additional epigenetic analysis was conducted considering the subcohort of 28 samples that exhib- ited long-COVID symptoms. The study has some limitations due to experimental constraints, cases and controls were not perfectly bal- anced on each BeadChip. 900 ng of high-quality genomic DNA was bisulfite converted using the EZ DNA methylation kit (D5001, Zymo Research Corporation) The methylation level for each CpG site is represented as B-values based on the fluorescent intensity ratio between methylated and unmethylated probes. Estimation of biological age (Horvath, Hannum, PhenoAge, DNAm skin, and blood) and telomere length (surrogate marker Gene annotation of SEMs was obtained using the web tool wWANNOVAR. Outlier val- ues were then classified as hyper-methylated or hypo- methylated with respect to the median values of the controls’ corresponding probes. For testing associations between cases and SEM, a method for rare variants analysis was applied using the SCAT-O method.

Long COVID is an often debilitating illness that occurs in at least 10% of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections. More than 200 symptoms have been identified with impacts on multiple organ systems. At least 65 million individuals worldwide are estimated to have long COVID. Long COVID (sometimes referred toas ‘post-acute sequelae of COVID-19’) isa multisystemic condition comprising often severe symptoms that follow asevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. At least 65 million individuals around the world have long COVID. Diagnostic and treatment options are insufficient, and clinical trials must be prioritized that address leading hypotheses. A higher prevalence of long Covid has been reported in certain ethnicities, including people with Hispanic or Latino heritage. Socio-economic risk factors include lower income and an inability to adequately rest in the early weeks after developing COVID-19. Multiple studies have found elevated levels of autoantibodies in long COVID. Reactivated viruses, including EBV and HHV-6, have been found in patients with long COVID'*”*’ (and have been identified in ME/CFS*) EBV reactivation is associated with fatigue and neurocognitive dysfunction. SARS-CoV-2 can damage many organ systems. Long-term changes to the size and stiffness of blood cells have also been found in long COVID. Circulatory system disruption includes endothelial dysfunction and subsequent down- stream effects. Increased risks of deep vein thrombosis, pulmo- nary embolism and bleeding events. SARS-CoV-2 infections increased the risk of cardiac arrest, death, diabetes, heart failure, pulmonary embolism and stroke. There is clear increased risk of developing myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) and dysautonomia. More than 1.3 million people who had COVID-19 showed mental health conditions such as anxiety and depression returned to normal over time, but increased risks of cognitive impairment. Possible mechanisms for these neuropathologies include neuro- inflammation, damage to blood vessels by coagulopathy and endothe- lial dysfunction, and injury to neurons. ME/CFS is a multisystem neuroimmune illness with onset often fol- lowing a viral or bacterial infection. Up to 75% of people with ME/C FS cannot work full-time and 25% have severe ME/ CFS, which often means they are bed-bound, have extreme sensitivity to sensory input and are dependent on others for care’. There are several hypothesized mechanisms for long COVID pathogenesis. These include immune dysregulation, microbiota disruption, autoimmunity, clotting and endothelial abnormality, and dysfunctional neurological signalling. The overlap of postviral conditions with these conditions should be explored further. Menstruation and the week before menstruation have been identified by patients as triggers for relapses of long COVID symptoms. Declined ovarian reserve and reproductive endocrine disorder have been observed in people with COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 infection affects ovary hormone production and/or the endometrial response. Long COVID gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, abdominal pain, loss of appetite, heartburn and constipation. Persisting respiratory and neurological symptoms are each associated with specific gut pathogens. SARS-CoV-2 RNA is present in stool samples of patients with COVID-19. There are currently no broadly effective treatments for long COVID, but treatments for certain components have been effective for subsets of populations. Early research into biomarkers suggests that levels of extracellular vesicles and/or immune markers indicating high cytotoxicity’ could be indicative of longCOVID. Dogs can identify individuals with long CO VID on the basis of sweat samples'*°. Pilot studies and case reports have revealed additional treat- ment options worth exploring. Paxlovid should be investigated further for prevention and treatment of long COVID. Sulodexide in individuals with endothelial dysfunction sawareductioninsymptomseverity’”. There is a wide range of possible treatment options from ME/CFS. Most need to be clinically tri- alled, which should happen urgently. Many newer treatment options remain underexplored, including anticoagulants and SARS-CoV- 2-specific antivirals. PCR tests are our best tool for detecting SARS-CoV-2 infections, but their false negative rates are still high'*°. False negative rates higher in women and adults younger than 40 years’, those with a low viral load'** and children. Misinformation on PCR and antibody tests has resulted in the categorization of patients with long COVID into non-COVID-19 control groups. Mild cases that result in long COVID often have an underlying biology different from acute severe cases. This is despite basic tests such as D-dimer, C-reactive protein (CRP) and antinuclear antibody tests and complete blood count being known to often return normal results. Tests that return abnormal results in patients with ME/CFS and dysautonomia should instead be prioritized. We need a comprehensive long COVID research agenda that builds on the existing knowledge from ME/CFS, dysautonomia and other viral-onset conditions. Robust clinical trials must bea priority moving forward as patients currently have few treatment options. Researchers must work within communities of colour, LGBTQ+ communities and low- income communities. As of 2013, only 6% of medical schools fully cover ME/CFS across the domains of treatment, research and curricula. To ensure people with long COVID and associated conditions can receive adequate care now, professional societies and government agencies must educate the health-care and research workforce on these illnesses.

Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is a debilitating idiopathic disease characterized by unexplained fatigue that fails to resolve with sufficient rest. Epigenetic modifications, such as CoG methylation, are known to regulate long-term phenotypic differences. Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is an idiopathic disease characterized by pro- found and debilitating fatigue, cognitive impairment, unrefreshing sleep, autonomic manifestations and post- exertional malaise. Many studies have reported alterations in the hypothalamic-pituitary- adrenal (HPA) axis. Epigenetic modifications, including the methylation of DNA at CpG dinucle Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) were isolated by Ficoll gradient centrifugation and resuspended in 1X Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) + 1% fetal bovine serum (FBS) The remaining PBMCs were cryopreserved in 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), 50% FBS, and 40% Roswell Park Memorial In- stitute 16 DNA methylation differences on the 450 K array are known to either be con- founded due to genetic polymorphisms or masked due to the large presence of invariably methylated sites in the gen- ome. We considered loci as dif- ferentially methylated, when comparing ME/CFS patients Page 3 of 14 with healthy controls, if they met the all of the following criteria. We used a nested primer design to enhance amplification of regions targeted for methylation analysis by bisulfite pyrosequencing. Cryopreserved PBMCs were available from ME/CFS pa- tients (7 = 33) and healthy controls (1 = 24) that were also examined by DNA methylome array (see above) All assays were performed in triplicate. ME/CFS patients had lower health-related qual- ity of life than healthy controls. There were no differences in the average age or BMI of the clinical groups. The top 5 hypo- and hypermethylated sites according to the magnitude of methylation differences are listed in Table 2. 71.6% of the differentially methylated loci were hyper- methylated and 28.4% were hypomethylated. The amount of hypermethylation decreased as dis- tance increased from a CpG island. Glucocorticoid sensitivity was not associated with type of ME/CFS onset or RAND-36 survey. The JRK sites were selected for the following reasons: these were among the top sites in terms of magnitude difference that showed a >5% methylation difference on the 450 K. The top sites show-5% difference based on magnitude difference on 450 K array. Glucocorticoid sensitivity was greater among ME/CFS patients overall compared to healthy controls. Methylation differences <5% on the 450 K array were not reliably detected for these comparison conditions. To determine potential epigenomic loci associated with glucocorticoid sensitivity, we examined the overlap in nominally significant loci across the three com- parisons. We found 13 loci that were differentially methylated in both the ME/CFS GC-Hypersensitive vs. Controls (green) and ME/ CFSGC-Typical (blue) comparisons Over 1,600 differentially methylated regions with a >5% methylation difference between CFS and controls that showed a significant relationship with overall RAND-36 score. 71.6% of these sites were hypermethylated in ME/CFS and hypermethylation was found to decrease as distance from a CpG island increased. The difference in glucocorticoid sensitivity was associated with differential methylation in 13 sites. Increased methylation was observed at GpG sites of GSTM1, (b) MYO3B, and (c) GSTMS in the ME/CFS GC-Hypersensitive subjects. There is a known relationship between oxidative stress and epigenetic modifications. DNA le- sions are often produced from oxidative stress states, which in turn affect the multiple levels of epigenetic regulation, leading to aberrant DNA methylation and gene expression patterns. Genes associated with neuronal cell development were also a major class of genes differentially methylated in ME/CFS patients. We found 13 sites associated with glucocorticoid sensi- tivity in ME/CFS GC-Hypersensitive patients. Six of the 13 sites were part of known coding genes, four of which have roles in cellular metabolism. The top 3 sites corresponded to GSTM1, MYO3B, and GSTM5, all of which showed >10% increase in methy- lation. DNA methylation modifications associated with quality of life health scores. Over 1600 differentially methylated regions that were significantly associated with overall RAND-36 score. Scores from this survey may point towards alterations in Page 11 of 14 biological systems. Future work should examine DNA methylation signatures during exercise challenge in ME/CFS. The results of this study highlight the potential util- ity of immune cell subtyping within the ME/CFS population. Epigenetic data may aid in elucidating relevant biological pathways impacted by ME/ CFS. Clinical investigations of the regulation of cellular metabolism are needed to assess this possi- bility. The study adhered to the human experimentation guidelines as outlined by the Helsinki Declaration of 1975. The collection of and analysis of clinical information and biological samples by the SolveCFS BioBank was ethically approved by the Genetic Alliance ethics review board and the University of Toronto.

This article reports on a detailed review of the cognitive behavioural model. Our review finds that the model lacks high-quality evidential support, conflicts with accounts given by most patients and fails to account for accumulating biological evidence. There is little scientific credibility in the claim that psycho-behavioural therapies are a primary treatment for this illness. Several diag- nostic criteria have been proposed to help identify potential cases. A wide range of treatments have been tested on ME/CFS patients. Over the last two decades, cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and graded exercise therapy (GET) have been used to treat the condition. The PACE trial reported a recovery rate of 22 per cent using CBT, whereas re-analysis of data from PACE puts recovery below 10 per cent. Findings from these trials resulted in criticism that the efficacy of these treatments is poor. In response, we undertake a review of the ‘cognitive behavioural model of ME/CFS’ to assess model applicability and validity. Cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) aims to ‘ optimize patients’ level of physical and psychosocial functioning’ CBT seeks to reverse so-called ‘dysfunctional beliefs’ in ME/CFS patients. CBM is embedded within a grand biopsycho- social (BPS) model. beliefs about the unacceptability of experiencing or expressing negative thoughts and emotions can play a central role in the development and maintenance of clinical problems. CBT aims to help patients consider other, less threatening explanations for their symptoms and pulls the victim out of a downward spiral of depressive thinking, somatising and catastrophising. The CBM is a theoretical framework for both the testing of CBT-GET in clinical trials and as a rationale for treatment of ME/CFS in clinical practice. Vercoulen et al.’s (1998) model characterises patients with CFS as having insufficient motivation for physical activity or recovery, lacking an internal locus of control, and maintaining a self-defeating preoccupation with symptoms. The evidence-base for CBT and GET in ME/ ME/CES is difficult to diagnose, and clinical trials of CBT for ME/CFS often include patients with psychiatric condi- tions who may respond positively to psychotherapy. Many patients seen in CFS treatment studies appear to be drawn from psychiatric centres with high rates of psy- chiatric morbidity. The first, large randomised trial of immune therapy and CBT for patients with CFS in Australia found no benefit for CBT (alone or in combination) over nonspecific treatment regimens. Sharpe et al. (1996) recruited 60 CFS patients to a randomised controlled trial (RCT) in Oxford and reported that almost three quarters of patients given CBT improved. The PACE trial demonstrated that little improvement in objective tests of physical function and the size of between-group differences (CBT-GET vs pacing therapy or standard medical care) was not sustained at 2-year follow-up. Across RCTs, recovery rates are inconsistent, do not mirror objective scoring of improve- ment and fall away over the long term. Many ME/CFS sufferers experience post-exertional malaise (PEM) PEM is a worsening of symptoms following activity caused by physiological and cellular changes. Patients with ME/ CFS are 10.4 times more likely to experience PEM com- pared with healthy controls. ME/CFS is linked with exposure to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), Coxsackie B, human herpes virus (HHV) 6 and 7, and Coxiella burnetii. Chia and Chia (2008) proposed a link between ME/C FS and entero- virus infection in the stomach after 135 of 165 CFS patient (82%) biopsies stained positive for VP1 within parietal cells. Low level of recovery observed in clinical trials and clinical practice counters claims that the illness can be cured using psycho-behavioural therapies. Major factors, such as ‘patients limiting activity’, ‘perfectionism’ or ‘holding beliefs about infection’ showed no risk association. Case-control study tested whether patients with CFS have exercise phobia (fear of activity) No increase in symptomatic anxiety in CFS patients compared with healthy controls. This suggests that fatigue was not caused by current levels of inactivity. There is a tendency to search out evidence to support the theory underpinning the CBM of ME/CFS. The ‘cognitive behavioural model’ of ME/CFS is premised on a theory that patients hold irrational and dysfunctional beliefs/cognitions that influence behaviours and illness con- tinuance. We find that this model narrative is contested by most patients (Spandler and Allen, 2017) —a clear warning light. In addition, research evidence continues to refute the model. ME/CFS is perpetuated by excessive rest is not evidence-based. A more rational explanation is that sufferers will continually test their limits of ability and will adjust accordingly. The stress, anxiety and depression detected in patients is likely related to a combination of brain and central nervous system inflammation and physical distress. 20 per cent of patients with CFS report adverse reactions to CBT. Clinical trials such as PACE define serious adverse events to include death, hospitalisations or significant deterioration, while new symptoms are consid- ered non-serious adverse events (White et al., 2007) The CBM of ME/CFS is fundamentally flawed and should be abandoned as an explanatory-treatment model. An alternative model should be formulated to better explain biological factors that predispose, precipitate and per- petuate the illness. An explanatory model needs to closely resemble illness pathogenesis and provide logic-driven linkages between factors.

DNA from a well-characterised New Zealand cohort of 10 ME/CFS patients and 10 age-/sex-matched healthy controls was isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear (PBMC) cells. Analysis of differentially methylated gene bodies (exons/introns) identified 122 unique genes. Major differences were identified in the DNA methylation patterns of ME/CFS patients. Over half found in gene bodies with RRBS in this study had been identi- fied in other ME/ CFS studies using the same cells but with array technology. Within the enriched functional immune, metabolic and neurological pathways, a number of enriched neurotransmitter and neuropeptide reactome pathways highlighted a disturbed neurological pathophysiology. Disease onset itself often follows a major ‘stress’ event, with a viral infection commonly reported by patients. This has established the hypothesis that onset of ME/CFS requires a stressor event coupled with a normally ‘silent’ component of genetic risk. DNA methylation is the best understood epigenetic modification where the addition of a methyl group to the cytosine base of DNA is associated with changes in gene expression. This biological interface between an individual� Study aimed to identify changes in the PBMC DNA methylation of a New Zealand cohort of ME/CFS patients. This included identification of dif- ferentially methylated genes and regulatory regions linked to functional pathways. Data were aligned to the human genome hg19 using Bismark [15] and analyzed following two independent analysis approaches. Using DMAP analysis, 76 DNA fragments were identi- fied as differentially methylated out of 146,575 analysed RRBS fragments. Of these DMFs, 52% were hypo-methylated with 48% were hyper- methylated in ME/CFS patients compared with the healthy controls. The major proportion of the DMFs were within intergenic regions (43%) and in intronic regions of protein-coding gene (27%) Methylation was mapped to annotated human genome data. Sites were annotated to known genomic regions including promoter, intronic, exonic and intergenic regions. Of the 349 DMCs, 56% were hypo-methylated and 44% hyper- methylated in ME/CFS patients compared with healthy controls. Clusters of differential methylation within regulatory features identify mitochondrial and immune-related genes. The length of the genome covered by the clusters var- ied with the largest being 1570 bp and smallest 200 bp. Investigation of these regions revealed a number of regulatory features including enhancers, DNase hypersensitivity regions and regions of Enhancer/ Gene regulatory associations. These regions of regulatory importance were associated with 17 protein- encoding genes with various functions. MethylKit analysis identified a larger number of promoter-associated genes with 45 DMCs falling within 22 promoter regions. Of these individual cytosines, 69% were hypo-methylated in ME/CFS patients compared to controls. Table 4 shows the genes linked to promoter regions associated with the top differentially methylated individual cytosines in ME/CFS patients and healthy controls. Table 4 also includes the chromosome in which the cluster was located along with a brief description of the gene function. All are associated with hypo-methylated clusters except the rows highlighted italic that indicate association with a hyper- methylated cluster to controls. There were equal proportions of hyper- and hypo- methylated sites in ME/CFS patients compared with healthy controls. The protein-encoding genes with the most DMCs (MethylKit analysis) were PARD6 and SKA3. There were no overlaps between the separate DMAP and MethylKit analyses in the gene bodies they identified. For each Gene ID, there is the corresponding number of CpGs within the identifying fragment, the average percentage methylation for the control subjects and ME/CFS patients, with differences. P values and F test values (degrees of freedom in brackets) are shown. Figure 5a shows that those genes differentially methyl- ated in our study were also identified in each of the other studies. Of the 122 genes found in our New Zealand study, 52% were also identified in the Trivedi et al. 2018 study. A smaller study in 2014 by de Vega et. [C in Fig. 5a] had identified 11% of the genes that were found in the current study. For each gene, the number of CpGs within the fragment, and methylation percentages of control subjects and ME/CFS patients are shown. Of the 122 genes identified by the two analysis platforms in our study, 42 were identified in all 3 studies (A+B -+ New Zealand), 21 in only Trivedi et al. 2018 and our study. No significant enriched func- tional pathways were identified based on the differentially methylated promoter-associated genes. A total of 7 pathways were associated with the 91 differentially methylated gene bodies (exons/introns) identified from the single cytosine Methylkit analysis. None of the overlaps between our New Zealand study and the de Vega et al. [7] were unique to that study, but were also found in the other two studies. Multiple statistical approaches were taken in order to detect as many meaningful changes as possible. To detect broad changes in DNA methylation likely linked to functional changes, the fragment-based DMAP analy- sis was utilised. To both support and build upon this ini- tial approach, individual cytosine methylation was also interrogated utilising MethylKit. The platform used for this investigation is highly reli- able with replicate RRBS library preparations. There are differences in both study designs and analysis strategies in the studies that utilised array-based platforms. Two studies report almost exclusively hypo-methylation changes, while the other three predominately hyper-methylated changes. The NZ study used the Canadian Consensus Criteria [29] for diagnosis. The other studies used patients diagnosed by this criteria and the earlier 1994 Fukuda diagnostic criteria. We compared the available gene lists produced by the array-based analyses performed in these five previous investigations with those derived from our study. The table includes the cell type utilised, the method used in the analysis, the numbers and gender included in the cohort, diagnostic criteria of the patients and the statistical thresholds utilised in the analyses. 59% (72/122) of the genes identified in the New Zealand study had been observed in one or more of the previ- ous studies DNA methylation within the regulatory regions of genes has been known to negatively correlate with gene expression. Clusters of differential methylation in genes UCP2, LONP1 and NDUFA11I related to mitochondrial function sug- gest impaired functioning. proteins in the ME/CFS patients were differentially expressed. Proteins involved in mitochondrial function, oxidative phospho- rylation, electron transport chain complexes, and redox regulation. The observed differential methylation in regulatory regions of genes associated with immune and inflam- matory responses is not unexpected due the known pathophysiology of the disease. DNA methylation within gene bodies (exons/introns) has been associated with changes in gene expres- sion with hyper-methylation of the first exon often asso- ciated with an inverse correlation with gene expression. In order to explore the systematic changes in expression, pathway enrichment analysis of the genes associated with differential methylation was erformed. The majority of the functional pathways identified were due to the presence of five /ypo-methylated genes (inter A large number were neu- rotransmitter and neuropeptide-related KEGG Pathways including; Serotonergic, Glutamatergic, GABAergic, Oxytocin, Dopaminergic, Apelin and Relaxin signal- ling. Neurotransmitters themselves have been hypothesised to play a role in the symptom presentation of ME/CFS. ME/CFS patients and controls were recruited from Dunedin NZ. Diagnosis of ME/C FS was made by Dr Rosamund Vallings of the Howick Health and Medi- cal Centre, Auckland, NZ. All patients report a loss of normal function with the majority either housebound or with limited activity and unable to work. Genomic DNA (500 ug) was digested with 160 units MSP1 restriction enzyme. Following end repair and adenylation of 3’ ends, adaptors were ligated to the DNA fragments. Bisulphite conversion was per- formed using the specifications of the EZ DNA methyla- tion Kit. Semi-quantitative PCR was performed to determine the opti- mal amplification cycle needed for the final large scale PCR of the library. This study was carried out under an ethics approval from the Southern Health and Disability Ethics Committee of New Zealand.

Liu and Siegmund BMC Genomics (2016) 17:469 The DNA methylation level, called Beta value, is estimated by the ratio of the methylated to the sum of methylated and unmethylated intensities. Issues encountered during probe design resulted in the implementation of two types of chemical assays. In this study nine processing methods are applied and compared in four datasets. methods include both between-array and within-array normalization methods, as well as combination approaches that sequentially apply procedures addressing different platform biases. The datasets range from cancer data to Alzheimer’s brain data, showing distinctly different variation in DNA methylation. All analyses are implemented in R version 3.0.3, Bioconductor version 2.12 and Funnorm. SWAN is based on the assumption that probes with the same number of CpGs in the probe body should have similar intensity distributions. For the methylated and unmethylated intensities separately, a random subset of type I and II probes matched on underlying CpG number are selected and quantile normalized. Funnorm is a between-sample (functional) normalization method that attempts to remove unwanted variation. Five datasets are used to evaluate the different process- ing methods. The motivation is that better signal processing should lead to better reproducibility in identifying differ- ential methylation. All samples are analyzed using the Infinitum Human- Methylation450 BeadChip. DNA methylation levels are reported as Beta (f) values, the proportion of methyla- tion intensity to the total intensity. A total of 376 bulk brain samples obtained from the middle temporal gyrus were analyzed over 8 plates. Of these, 215 are from patients diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and 161 are from controls, frequency matched by age and sex. Data are analyzed on the Beta-value scale and tests are two-sided. ROC analysis is performed using ROCR package in R (version 1.0-7) A total of 485,512 cytosines are queried by the HM450 BeadChip array. For method evaluation, we filter probes with missing Beta values across samples. All processing methods reduce the average standard deviation com- pared to the raw data. The correlation between standard deviations and means is least obvious after application of Dasen and SQN. Funnorm shows good stability despite the use of principal components estimated from only six arrays. Based on the well identified spatial correlation of DNA methylation at scales < 500 bp [23], we expect that the ideal normalization would be to normalize methylated and unmethylated intensities. Cross-platform comparison with whole-genome bisulfite sequencing. We used five lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) samples from TCGA to benchmark the post-processing HM450 Beta value estimates to estimates from WGBS. Noob + BMIQ seems to show the greatest reduction in deviation between measures from adjacent type I/type II probes. Fig. 2 Cross-platform comparison of Beta values from HumanMethylation450 vs whole-genome bisulfite sequencing. For the two cancer data sets, all within-array combination methods show similar performance to one another and all show higher concordance compared to the raw data (Fig. 4a and c). The performances of between-array methods show more variability. The COAD study shows a clear loss in sensitivity when performing between- sample normalization using SQN (Fig. 4d) Reproducibility for the Brain data is much lower than for the cancer data, which was not surprising either based on the earlier MDS figures. This time the greatest overlap occured for the between-array method Funnorm combined with (within-array) BMIQ. Applying RUVm to Noob + BMIQ processed brain data resulted in a nearly 30 % improvement in overlap percent- age, achieving a max 63 % overlap in the brain data set, up from 36 % observed using normalization methods alone (Fig. 5c). The results using R UVm depended heavily on. surrogate variable analysis (SVA) [25] and ComBat [26]. Ruvm improved result reproducibility, outperforming both SVA and Com Noob + BMIQ performed best in reducing differences between Beta values in intra-plate duplicates. SQN, a between- array method that normalizes intensities between typel/ II probes, did the least to remove probe type bias. When disease state was not associated with the principal scaling dimension, between-array methods tended to improve sensitivity of reproduced signals. This study provides a comprehensive comparison of the currently popular normalization methods in processing HM450 array data. Combinations of methods are applied and compared in five data sets, ranging from cancer data to Alzheimer’s brain data. We find that the combination of Noob + BMIQ, a within-array method, performs well in reducing technical variance and adjusting typel/II bias. The study was published in the journal BMC Genomics.

Quality and Bias were assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklist for Case Control Studies. Potential biomarkers ranged from genetic/epigenetic (19.8%) to immunological (29.7%) Most biomarkers had secondary (43.56%) or tertiary selectivity. There is a significant body of biological evidence for ME/CFS. Lack of definitive biomarkers complicates diagnosis and management. This systematic review aims to collate evidence on suggested biomarkers. The following databases were systematically searched for literature with biomarker key words in conjunction with fatigue syndrome, chronic. The literature search was conducted on 30th May 2022. All included articles underwent peer review. Unpublished literature or pre-print data- bases such as medRxiv were not searched. Duplicates were removed using Endnote version 20 (Endnote, Clarivate™, Philadelphia, USA) JBI CACCCS is a qualitative check- list, and there is no scoring system. 98 out of 101 included publications were observa- tional case-control studies. The average sample size of ME/CFS patients and HC included across all the studies was 1=43.83 and n=38.34, respectively. There were 20 studies that discussed genetic/epigenetic biomarkers in ME/CFS patients compared with HC. 76 of the biomarkers were blood-based (75.25%) and had either secondary (43.56%) or tertiary (53.47%) selectivity. AUC, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were reported in only some of the studies. Maksoud et al. reported higher levels of miR-21, miR -34a, mi-92a, and mi-200c in plasma of ME/CFS patients compared with HC. Brenu and colleagues found a significantly lowermiR- 21 in CD8* T cells and NK cells in ME/ CFS patients. Thirty studies investigated immune cell function changes in ME/CFS patients compared with HC. Five of the studies reported reduced NKCC in patients compared to HC. Other NK cell-specific features include lower expres- sion levels of DPPIV/C26. ME/CFS patients had higher levels of anti-EBV-dUTPase antibodies and anti-human dUTP enzyme antibodies compared to HC. Plasma peroxide and oxidised low-density lipopro- tein antibody concentrations were significantly higher in ME/C FS patients compared with HC. There was low association with these antibodies and fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome rating scale. Five studies reported on changes in metabolites in ME/CFS patients compared with HC. Pathway analysis conducted by each of the studies suggested that disrupted metabo- lites may impact amino acid (mentioned in 4/5 stud- ies) and/or energy metabolism pathways. After mitogenic stimulation, there were signifi- cant increases in IL-10, IFN-y and TNF-a. ME/CFS patients had lower metabolic pathways associated with unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis and increased atrazine degrada- tion pathways independent of IBS comorbidity. ME/ CFS patients with IBS had significantly higher unclassi- fied allistripes and less Faecalibacterium compared with HC. ME/CFS patients had. higher omega-6 linoleic acid-derived oxylipins compared with male HC. In emales, phosphatidylinositol, saturated triglyceride lev- els and hexosylceramides were lower. Circulating EV was investigated in four studies [16, 19, 24, 30]. Three studies found sig- nificantly higher circulating EV numbers. There were no significant changes in axial and mean diffusivity between FC ME/CFS patients and HC. Bilateral white matter volumes were significantly lower in ME/ CFS patients. There was a significant association between RR scores. in the anterior Page 8 of 18 node of the default mode network. Nelson et al. reported that there was lower post-exercise heart rate recovery in ME/CFS patients compared with HC. In an earlier publication by the same author, work rate at ventilatory threshold was found to be lower in ME/. CFS patients than HC on day 2 of CPET. There is no consensus on a biomarker for ME/CFS. Several markers have been suggested as potential candidates. This study gives an overview of poten- tial biomarkers. Females were more prominent across the studies. Majority of the participants in this review are diag- nosed according to FC. This indicates that stratifying patients accord- ing to case criteria may allow for additional meaningful observations. Post COVID-19 patients with and without ME/CFS dem- onstrated elevated levels of ET-1 compared with HC. The majority of the biomarkers were blood-based. Blood-based biomarkers are recognised as accessible, direct and non-invasive, especially in at-risk populations. Immune dysfunction was the most prevalent biomarker type investigated. NKCC and function were significantly reduced in ME/CFS patients compared with HC. MiR-21 is a highly conserved, non-specific marker implicated in at least 29 diseases. The emergence of whole genome sequencing may allow for a more comprehensive high-throughput characterisation. There is evidence of widespread genetic, immune, neurologi- cal, mitochondrial and endocrine differences in ME/CFS compared with HC. The major characteristics that were found was that the activity of the brain of patients was more com- plex. Exercise testing fell under the complex and indirect biomarker. ME/CFS onset often occurs following an environmental trigger/s such as infection, trauma or chemical insult. The studies also do not cater for poten- tial delays in onset of PEM where some patients reported symptoms presenting post 24 h. A rig- available in most settings and has severe, long-term con- _orous approach is required for biomarkers to enter into sequences to patients for an indirect measure of ME/CFS. Stability is an important component when consider- ing biomarkers. Most of these biomarkers fall under “moderate to Weigl described the importance of a biomarker’s ability to difficult-to-detect’ There were only two studies that investigated biomarkers longitu- dinally, one that measured NK cell subtypes iNKT and NKG2D and one that investigated NKCC over time. Many of the studies investigated were standalone stud- ies with insufficient or proof-of-concept sample sizes. It is difficult to compare studies of the same marker as their methodology varied significantly including cell or tissue type. This systematic review identifies potential associations between the findings and highlights that these systems do not work independently. The heterogeneity shown across many of the included studies highlights the need for multidisciplinary research and uniform protocols in ME/CFS biomarker research. This review also corroborates the use of NK cells as a suitable model to investigate the pathomechanism of this illness.

Post-acute COVID-19 syndrome (PACS) has been defined as symptoms persisting after clearance of a CO VID-19 infec- tion. We compared DNAm patterns in patients with PACS with those in controls and in healthy convalescents and found a unique DNAm signature in PACS patients. This signature unravelled modified pathways that regulate angio- tensin Il and muscarinic receptor signalling. The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying PACS remain largely unknown. Healthy COVID-19 convalescents carry a distinct DNA methylation (DNAm) pattern in their peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) The aim of the current study was to further elucidate the DNAm pattern of PACS patients. The data from the PACS patients were compared to the existing data from our previous study [2] on convales- cent COVID-19 in which inclusions were done during 2020. PACS samples had significantly stronger IgG responses against SARS-CoV-2 RBD com- pared to the CC19 group. The PACS subjects all had significant levels of anti-RBD antibodies. We found that 38 of the identified DMGs were repre- sented among the 5221 proteins that were known to be exploited by SARS-CoV-2 (Additional file 1: Fig. $2). Exploration of protein-protein interactions (PPI) to detect possible modules among these 38 DMGs revealed that most of the proteins were connected in a PPI net- work. This is the first report of epigenome-wide DNAm alterations in subjects with PACS. The CpG sites with the most pronounced changes compar- ing PACS with CC19 were found in genes encoding SNORD3B, CETP and DLGAP. Several of the pathways that we found epigeneti- cally modulated in PACS subjects, including Angiotensin II receptor, muscarinic receptors and histamine signal- ling pathways, are relevant for The PPI modules that we found to be epigenetically modulated include cellular processes that are central to vesicle formation. We cannot exclude the possibility that the PACS specific epigenetic signature is driven by a hidden SARS-CoV-2 reservoir. The impact of vaccination on DNAm profiles is not possible to determine and should be evaluated in future analyses. The datasets used from Huoman J. et al. study will be available via secure token at the GeneExpression Omnibus with GEO-ID GSE178962.

Long COVID following mild SARS-CoV-2 infection: characteristic T cell alterations and response to antihistamines. Longitudinal Study of DNA Methylation and Epigenetic Clocks Prior to and Following Test-Confirmed COVID-19 and mRNA Vaccination. The host epigenetic landscape rapidly changes during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Evidence suggest that severe COVID-19 is associated with durable scars to the epigenome. Epigenetic mechanisms including DNA methylation are critically involved in both host immune responses to viral infection and subsequent diseases pathogenesis and severity. The severity of COVID-19 strongly depends on age, and aging biomarkers may help explain this relationship. Distinct DNA methylation patterns have been utilized to derive epigenetic measures of biological aging termed ‘epigenetic clocks’ We first examined whether alterations to DNA. methylation states, blood immune cell type composition, and. epigenetic clocks occurred in peripheral blood following COVID.-19 using a longitudinal study design of 21 healthy participants. Next, we evaluated longitudinal DNA Genome-wide DNA methylation was assayed from blood biospecimens of all participants at baseline and post-COVID-19 using the Illumina MethylationEPIC platform (Pidsley et al., 2016) The earliest captured participant's post-Co VID-19 DNA methylating was within 1 week following diagnosis and ranged out to a maximum of 6 months. Genome-wide DNA methylation data generated from 21 participants. 57.8% of the COVID-19-related DML increased in DNA. methylation states (hypermethylation) post-CO VID-19 compared to pre-timepoint for participants. Notable enrichments were observed in actively transcribed genes of the digestive system. Methylation-Based Estimates of Cell-Type Fractions in Blood Are Significantly Changed Following COVID-19 Infection. DNA methylation data can be utilized to infer fractions of immune cell types present in a heterogenous blood sample. Since the immune system undergoes dramatic aging-related changes, our analysis stratified human immune system.

We sought to test whether the 516 genes containing a differentially methylated loci we identified overlapped with COVID-19-related genes transcriptionally altered during SARS-CoV-2 infection. This analysis revealed significant overlap with genes that are differentially expressed in animal models and in vitro infection models. These findings suggest the DNA methylation patterns associated with CO VID-19 likely play a role in transcriptional activation or We calculated epigenetic estimates for Horvath’s multi-tissue predictor DNAmAge based on 353 CpG sites. We found large bidirectional fluctuations in epigenetic age up to 8.99 years. Age is a well-known risk factor for COVID-19 severity. We observed that the PCPhenoAge clock was significantly increased in those over 50 years of age. PCPhenoAge was significantly decreased in those under 50 years of age following COVID-19 by an average of 2.06 years. PCGrimAge, a predictor of lifespan in unit of years, was significantly increased in people over 50 years old. We hypothesized that the CO VID-19 associated change was related to immune cell type compositional changes. We observed that the increase in the PCPenoAge clock estimates for participants following Combined Genes score 25.08 Pang et al Epigenetic Clocks and COVID-19. Blood immune cell compositional changes in CD4 T cells, NK cells, B cells, granulocytes, and plasmablasts. Loss in percent CD4* T cells for all participants significantly related to older chronological age and increasing epigenetic age. We examined 36 individuals (n = 21 females; n = 15 males) ranging in age from 22 to 69 years old that received either the Moderna or Pfizer mRNA vaccine. The median time since the second mRNA vaccine dose received by participants and DNA methylation data obtained for the post-vaccination timepoint was 57.9 days. Exploratory analyses stratified by received Moderna mRNA vaccination significantly reduced epigenetic age estimates based on PCHorvath1 by an average We tested whether artificial short-term in vitro exposure to SARS-CoV-2 virus (0.1 MOI) impacted PC-based epigenetic clocks in human peripheral mononuclear cells. We exposed viable PBMC’s from two uninfected donors (Donor 1, under 50 years of age; Donor 2: over 50 year of age) to a passage 4 stock of the virus in vitro for 60 h. We did not observe the evidence of MRNA COVID-19 vaccination decreases PCHorvath1 and PCHOrvath2 epigenetic age. DNA methylation in blood associate with SARS-CoV-2 infection at 756 CpG sites. These findings support epigenetic findings from other groups that have reported distinct DNA methylated states in blood. Among the COVID-19 differentially methylated loci detected in blood, we observed hypermethylation related to the caspase recruitment domain family member 14 (CARD14) gene. This gene encodes a protein that has been shown to interact with BCL10 that functions as a positive regulator of cell apoptosis. We observed a divergence in the epigenetic clock estimate PCPhenoAge and the mortality algorithm PCGrimAge based on age in individuals following COVID-19. Slight epigenetic age acceleration in the short term appeared in those individuals over 50 years of age that were infected with SARS-CoV-2. In contrast, epigenetic aged appeared to reduce in those people less than 50. These findings support the critical role of age as a risk factor. Age based on age during SARS-CoV-2 infection might involve the biological process of hormesis: moderate stressors can improve health by causing a compensatory response. COVID-19 might serve as a hormetic stress in non-hospitalized younger individuals, while it serves as a toxic stressor in older adults. The developed mRNA vaccines for COVID-19 have been shown to elicit a potent humoral immune response. The mechanisms that influence detrimental or beneficial changes in epigenetic clocks remains unclear. Future studies will need to harness serial sample collection of participants during the course of mRNA vaccination. The study was conducted between August 2020 and March 2021. The study design only included two time points to examine changes related to COVID-19 and mRNA vaccination comparing baseline and a short-term follow-up assessment of DNA methylation. Future studies will need to study a larger sample size and determine whether these age-related divergent changes to epigenetic clocks are durable. Pang et al.

Up to 30 of people infected with SARS report disabling symptoms 2 years after the infection. Post-Acute COVID-19 Symptoms (PACS) and/or long-COVID show significant clinical heterogeneity. To develop effective, patient-targeted treatment, a better understanding of underlying mechanisms is needed. Epigenetics has helped elucidating the pathophysiology of several ealth conditions and it might help unravelling inter-individual differences. Severity and mortality in acute COVID-19 was associated with older age and male sex. Risk factors for long-COVID include female sex and younger age. Epigenetics is the study of phenotype changes without changes in the DNA sequence. It has been shown to be involved in the pathophysiology of many diseases. A systematic summary of the current evidence is warranted, but is currently unavailable and represents an important knowledge gap. We report a systematic review aiming to summarize the avail- able literature exploring epigenetic changes associated with PACS or long-COVID. The search was performed on Medline, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science and medRxiv on 30th December 2022. Study data were extracted: first author’s name, study design, assessed epigenetic biomarkers, blood fraction assessed (cells, serum or plasma), type of partici- pants population (PACS or long-COVID), sample characteristics, sample size, hospitalization status, findings pertaining to the epigenetics of patients and the quality of the study. Expert Reviews in Molecular Medicine considered: chromatin accessibility, DNA methylation, miRNA and IncRNA profiling, and histone In total, six studies focussed on DNA methylation changes in peo- ple with persistent symptoms after COVID-19. In two of these six, persistent symptoms were related to an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) Two other studies included both subjects with and without evidence of lung compli- cations. No studies explored chromatin accessibility or histone modifications. Two main differences should be reported between the two studies. Mongelli et al. included patients at an earlier stage (from 4 weeks on) than Lee et al., who included patients with persistent symptoms of at least 8 weeks. Some of the patients included in Mongeelli et al’s study showed lung involvement. On the contrary, people with respiratory tract infection - not due to COVID-19, were in the control group in Lee's study. No between-group Patients showed a distinct DNA Fair Small sample size.

Other groups describe PACS and long- COVID as a multi-organ disease, where evidence of pul- monary, cardiovascular or nervous system alterations are consid- ered part of the disease. We urge future research to apply strict inclusion criteria and pro- vide a comprehensive clinical characterization of participants. All studies identified significant differential DNA methylation patterns between patients and con- trols in several genes. Patients with long-COVID show upregulation of miRNAs involved in fibrotic, cell death, vascularization, thrombosis and inflammation- related pathways. Many patients suffering from ME/CFS report their symptoms to have started after a viral infection. Epigenetic changes might help the understanding of PACS and long-COVID, elucidate their underlying mechanisms, aid sub- grouping and point towards tailored treatments. We urge future research to employ longitudinal, repeated-measures designs and aim for the best possible methodological quality.

In this year, COVID-19 and Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Coy-2) became a major public health issue. This article seeks to explain the these unsolved issues by analyzing the data associated with hosts’ epigenetic regulation. Angiotensin converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) type I can be a great candidate for the study of epigenetic mechanisms in Sars-Cov-2. Angiotensin converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the one that this article attaches great importance to discuss. ACE2 is a metalloenzyme containing a peptidase M2 domain and an amino acid transported domain that generally binds with SARS-CoV-2. There are two hot spots for viral binding in human ACE2. frequent mutations at receptor-binding motifs can also be regarded as the chief culprit of human infection. Changes in the epigenetic regulations of ACE2 gene cause the exacerbation of COVID-19. Many of human bodies’ biological properties are results of the coaction between epigenetic and genetic mechanisms. This article seeks to figure out whether the comorbidities associated with SARS- CoV-2 lead to the changes in host epigenome. Study: 2636 CpGs, 1405 genes, were differentially methylated in a significant manner under Bonferrni threshold ( P-value < 1x 10°’). Table III. SEX DISPARITIES in SMOKING PATTERNS IN USA [9] Health outcomes Men Women Smoking in the past month 42% 34% Many epitopes in the novel virus was different from SARS-CoV, revealing an urgent need to develop new antibodies. Remdesivir is the most compelling antiviral drug in this division, but there is not sufficient data to validate its efficacy. There are more than 15 candidates for the vaccine, for the sake of safety, they are currently all undergoing clinical trials. It has been proven that the reason why patients with both comorbidities and SARS-CoV-2 are more likely be infected and have a severe form of symptoms is that the hosts’ epigenome are altered in this case. On the basis of this hypothesis, the article proposes some novel the treatment options which focus on the epigenetic regulation of ACE2 genes.

Machine learning is promising in the development of assistive clinical tools for detection of e.g. cancers and prediction of disease. We now have an ever-growing number of reported epigenetic alterations in disease. This offers a chance to increase sensitivity and specificity of future diagnostics and therapies. This review was guided by the question, “What are the machine learning models that utilize DNA methylation to classify or diagnose disease states?” This review focused on three key aspects within the search strategy, namely, the data science technique, the biomedical technique, and the outcome of interest. This review is written in the context of the burgeoning interest for the medical practitioner in po- tential clinical applications of epigenetics and ML. Epigenetics is closely linked to environ- mental influences and is potentially better suited to disease diagnosis and treatment than genetics alone. Epigenetics has been shown to play a role in the me- diation between early life adverse environments and later life disease onset. The biggest successes to date in using epi- genetic information as a biomarker have been achieved in oncology. ML is a subdiscipline of AI that shows strong potential in the field of data-driven medical fields. ML enables computers to learn and make predictions by finding patterns within the data. ML algorithms are categorised into supervised, unsupervised, and deep learning. A simplified visual representation of the rela- tionship between these fields is presented in Fig. 2. Deep learning can perform both supervised and unsupervised tasks. Supervised learning usually requires user input in order to define training classes. Examples of supervised learning using epigenetic data include classification of metastatic brain tumours, prostate cancer, coronary heart disease, neurodevelopmental syn- dromes, and central nervous system tumours. supervised learning is one of the most widely used ML techniques in classification and prediction in epigenetics. Another class type of algorithm that can be used in su- pervised ML is deep learning. Deep learning algorithms are capable of processing high volume, high- dimensionality data. Recall is a measure that informs us how many cases we were able to identify as cases. Fi-score is the harmonic mean between precision and recall. The F1-score ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 is the worst performance. Unsupervised learning does not require labels in order to work. Unsupervised learning is useful to detect patterns in data sets that have large amounts of data points, such as those in micro- array and omics data sets. The main limitation of unsupervised ML is that the algorithms do not provide insight into the import- ance or relevance of clustering and/or associations. 16 studies were identified that utilised ML to diagnose or classify diseases. Epigenetic data have traits that make it amenable to ML. Large-scale, data- rich repositories such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), ENCODE, and the BLUEPRINT consortium provide large amounts of samples. Most datasets consist of DNA methylation pro- files derived from peripheral blood. A look at some of the most common words used to describe people in the U.S. and around the world. A look at a few of the words used in this article. A glance at the spelling of some words will help you understand what some of these words mean. Most epigenetic data sets have more variables than samples, making it difficult for many ML algorithms to function effectively. Not all associations in a DNA methylation data- set are linear. Several CpGs may be linked to the same gene which may influence other portions of the methy- lome and transcriptome. These challenges must be recognised before the full clinical potential of epigenetics is realised. Deep learning has been used to classify genetic mutations in gliomas and prediction of single-cell DNA methylation status. ML is starting to find patterns in ever-growing genetic and epigenetic data sets that relate to the development of diseases. Although very accurate, deep learning methods will need to undergo further research to define what is going on within the ‘black box’ Rauschert et al.

DNA methylation is arguably the most stable epigenetic mark that plays a key role in regulating development and disease. The rapid improvement in next-generation sequencing tech- nologies now provides opportunities to interrogate DNA methy- lation at single base resolution with high coverage across multiple samples. During the past few years, several alignment tools have been developed to cope with asymmetric mapping issues of bisulphite converted sequenced reads. In contrast to alignment and visualization tools, the number of software packages available to detect DMRs is small. Here, we describe differential methylation analysis package (DMAP), a pipeline that can directly import the output from any bisulPHite aligner in Sequence Alignment/Map (SAM) format. We have primarily designed the package DMAP provides genomic relationship information (nearest gene, exon, introns and CpG features) for each DMR or DMF. DMAP permits the user to interrogate the methylated (represented as + sign) and unmethylated (repre- sented as — sign) counts for single Cpg sites. DMAP includes options for investigating differen- tial methylation on a user-specified tiled window of any length. For RRBS, we introduced a new MspI fragment-based approach for investigating DNA methylation. This approach is conceptu- ally similar to the DMR approach, but instead of fixed-length windows, Mspi-digested fragments of 40-220 bp lengths were used as the unit of analysis. Methylation counts from the CpG at the junction of two adjacent fragments are attributed to the fragment from which they were derived. For RRBS, 29% non-MspI sequenced reads has been reported. Non-specific activity of the MspI enzyme and partially degraded DNA could result in reads without a Mspi start site. We observed a lower prevalence of non-MsplI reads in our test libraries. The Fisher’s exact test over a sliding window with a specified fold difference is a widely used approach for assessing differential methylation between two samples or groups of samples. For RRBS data analysis, for a given MspI fragment, Fisher's exact tests can be performed between multiple samples by giving a continuous list of SAM files in the command in diffmeth tool of DMAP. For WGBS data, instead of fragments, tiled windows of defined length can be investigated DMAP does not allow detection of differential methylation at single CpG sites. If investigation is sought, the diffmeth program of DMAP can produce + (methylated) and — (un methylated) counts. A simi- lar analysis can be performed using tiled windows. DMAP provides flexibility to the users to apply multiple test corrections methods. DMAP relates each DMF or DMR to the nearest gene by comparing the genomic coordinates of the start and the end of the DMF. It also provides CpG features (CpG island, shore or core) for a DMF and DMR. The program includes options for users to impose distance limits on how far valid genes can lie from the fragment. We performed a comparative performance analysis between DMAP, methylKit and BiSeq. DMAP completed the differential methylation analysis in <3.1 min, which was >5 times faster than methylKit. DMAP identified 367 significant DMFs (basic cutoff=0.05, adjusted P-value cutoff=5.34x 10~° after Bonferroni correction). The 367 DMFs contained 3215 CpG sites (Table 6). When we compared the co-ordinates of the DMCs from methylKit, we found that 318 of MethylKit identified a higher proportion of CpG sites that were Skb or further apart from the transcription start site (TSS>5kb) compared to the regions identified by DMAP and BiSeq. The CpGs that were common between all the three tools were more prevalent in far upstream of the genes. MethylKit and DMAP investigate differential methylation in the 4 million CpG sites or 647626 MspI fragments (in a 40-220 bp human RRBS genome), respectively. BiSeq considers the spatial arrangement of Cpg sites in the genome. Each program uses different statistical tests and parameters for defining the unit of DNA methylation analysis. DMAP is an analysis package that filters and pro- cesses aligned bisulphite sequenced data to generate comprehen- sive reference methylomes. From SAM files, DMAP provides statistically significant DMRs and relates them to genes and CpGs. DMAP is written in C and exe- cutes efficiently.

Long COVID is a debilitating chronic condition that has affected over 100 million people globally. Studies have largely failed to identify genetic associations behind the disease. This study compared two subpopulations of long COVID patients from San Francisco with patients with ME/CFS. Combinatorial analysis identified 73 genes that were highly associated with at least one of the long COVID populations. Of these, 9 genes have prior associations with acute COVID-19, and 14 were differentially expressed in a transcriptomic analysis. pathway enrichment analysis revealed that the biological pathways most significantly associated with the 73 long CO VID genes were mainly aligned with neurological and cardiometabolic diseases. Long COVID is a debili- tating syndrome that the World Health Organization estimates affects up to 20% of people infected by SARS-CoV-2. The long-term health consequences of long COVID remain unknown, with suggestions of a doubling of the risk of developing cardiovascular issues. Combinatorial analytics approaches identify combi- nations of features that together (rather than individu- ally) are associated with the disease phenotype. We used combinatorial analytics to iden- tify disease risk signatures. Genotypic and phenotypic data for both cases and con- trols included in this study were generated from Sano Genetics’ Long COVID GOLD study. Eligible par- ticipants (n=1996), recruited between 2020 and 2022, provided saliva samples for an at-home DNA Test. Taylor et al. Journal of Translational Medicine (2023) 21:775 Cohort characteristics At the time of analysis, a total of 1829 individuals in the GOLD study had a self-reported COVID-19 diag- nosis. This cohort had a median age of 50 years [interquartile range (IQR) =40—60] and median COVID 19 recovery time of 169 days. It consisted of 61.1% females and 92.6 World Health Organization defines long COVID patients as those experiencing one or more symptoms post initial COVID-19 infection. Severe cases were defined as those with a ‘Total Change’ score for these symptoms greater than or equal to the upper quartile of the distribution. Fatigue Dominant’ cohort was chosen primarily due to their phenotypic similarity with ME/CFS. The two case-control datasets underwent a series of quality control (QC) procedures before they were ana- lyzed using the PrecisionLife platform. Genotype data was filtered to exclude SNPs with minor allele frequency (MAF) <5%. Very low frequency SNPs were removed as significant combinations involving rare variants are espe- cially infrequent. The method prioritizes SNP genotype combinations that have high odds ratios, low p-values (p< 0.05 A permutation-based approach was used to compare the observed properties of the most highly associated SNP-genotype combina- tions to the null distribution for randomized datasets. Combinations passing these tests were reported as validated long COVID disease signatures. SNPs found in multiple disease signatures often form the central hub of the disease architecture. Ancestry inference for the samples in the GOLD study was performed using GRAF-pop. To maximize the number of samples included in each case-control data- set, samples of all ancestries were included in the analysis. Expanded genotypes analysis (“EGA”) tests how the gen- otype of a critical SNP from the disease signature affects the odds of disease when the genotypes of all interacting SNPs are held constant. The relationship between the critical SNP minor allele and disease phenotype is consistent across all or most expanded genotype signa- tures. This pattern holds even though patients with the criticalSNP minor allele have below average odds of disease when they also pos- sess the wild type genotype at the interacting SNP. Cross disease analysis can provide insights into potential drug repurposing opportunities or development of com- mon therapies. We compared the genes that were sig- nificantly associated with Severe and Fatigue Dominant long COVID against a variety of other chronic diseases to identify shared pathophysiological mechanisms. Only genes with strong target-disease genetic association scores (>0.9 out of 1.0) have been used in this analysis for each indication group. Using the PrecisionLife combinatorial analysis platform, we identified 86 disease associated critical SNPs for the Severe cohort and 84 for the Fatigue Dominant cohort, mapping to 43 and 36 genes respectively. A total of 74 unique genes were associated with at least one of the long COVID cohorts. The disease signatures associated with each cohort were all combinations of 2 or more SNP genotypes. All cases included in the analysis possessed at least one disease-associated SNP genotype. 118 (10%) disease signatures of the disease signatures found to be significant in the Severe cohort and 120 (8.4%) signatures in the Fatigue Dominant cohort passed the ancestry confounder analysis. For each gene, more than 70% of cases from both cohorts possessed at least one disease signa- ture containing an associated SNP. These genes have a range of different functions and potential mecha- nism of action hypotheses as to their role in the develop- ment of long COVID.

Table 9 List of the genes associated with Severe Fatigue. Table 10 list of genes found for the longCOVID cohort. The unique genes, the percentage of total cases they Dominant cohort. were associated with, and their biological functions are summarized in Tables 5 and 6. A comparative pathway enrichment analysis using the g:Profiler tool revealed that there were significant differences in the biological pathways associated with the lists of unique genes from the Severe and Fatigue Dominant cohorts. 14 of the 73 genes (Severe=7 and Fatigue Dominant =7) identified in our analyses were also differentially expressed at the tran- scriptomic level in patients experiencing long COVID (Additional file 5: Table $10) Long COVID genes shared the greatest number of biological processes with cardiovascular disease and mental or behavioral disease. The critical SNP is universally protective across at least 2 validated disease signatures for 3 of the 5 RF scored genes (ADIPOQ, NOL4, and PDE6C) SNX9 is consistently associated with more complex interactions that highlight the com- binatorial dynamics of disease. We identified a disease signature comprising three SNPs that is asso- ciated with strongly elevated odds of long COVID. Patients with the SNX9 heterozygous or homozygous minor allele genotype consistently have lower odds of developing severe long CO VID. SNX9 geno- type is a significant contributor to the risk of severe long COVID infection. The gene-disease relationship is context dependent and mediated by interactions with KLF15 and RYR3. Monogenic approaches such as GWAS that do not consider these gene—gene interactions can fail to detect potentially important drivers of disease. Using a systematic repositioning approach, we identified 13 long COVID targets that already have drugs in clinical development. As these drugs or development candidates may require fewer preclinical studies and already have a known safety profile, they could represent a quicker and de-risked strategy for developing poten- tial new treatments. We identified TLR4 as an attractive repurposing candidate. At least 9 of the genes identified have been linked to acute COVID- 19. The Severe long COVID cohort may have a more severe form of the acute infection. The pathway enrichment analysis highlighted an overrepresentation of genes involved in macrophage foam cell differentiation. dysregulated mitochondrial function, resulting in the inability to increase respiration rates in response to increased demand from stressors such as exercise, may result in post-exertional malaise. ClOCK (Circadian Locomotor Output Cycles Kaput) is an important regulator of circadian rhythm, disrup- tions of which have been associated with pain, insomnia, insulin resistance, immunological function and impaired mitochondrial function. We identified 3 common variants in the genes ATP9A, INSR and SLCISA4 in both Severe and Fatigue Dominant cohorts. Of the 27 pathways significantly enriched in the long COVID genes identified in this analysis, 16 (60%) are associated with gene targets previously associated with mental or behavioral disease. This includes indications such as major depressive disorder, anxi- ety disorder and schizophrenia. A recent meta-analysis of over 10,000 patients indicated that neurological and neuropsychiatric symptoms were some of the most reported 3 months after acute COVID-19. In the absence of consistent diagnosis and clinical reporting for POTS, we attempted to analyze the symptoms that patients reported. Tachycardia, diz- ziness, palpitations, brain fog and even in some cases POTS were recorded but in insufficient numbers for a meaningful analysis. Hospital admission with a more severe form of acute COVID-19 has previously been identified as a risk fac- tor for the development of long COVID.

Trivedi MS, Oltra E, Sarria L, Rose N, Beljanski V, Fletcher MA, et al. Identification of Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome-associated DNA methylation patterns. Risk of long COVID associated with delta versus omicron variants of SARS-CoV-2. DNA methylation levels of ME/CFS cases were similar to those of controls. Microarray-based approach allowed detection of 17,296 differentially methylated CpG sites in 6,368 genes across regulatory elements and within coding regions of genes. Analysis of DNA methylation in promoter regions revealed 307 differentiallymethylated promoters. DNA methylation patterns were found to be altered in several diseases often reported as comorbid to ME/CFS such as fibromyalgia (FM) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) These studies used Illumina Human Methylation450 BeadChip microarrays, which allow to analyze over 450,000 methylation sites per sample at single-nucleotide resolution. This additional coverage should facilitate uncovering addi- tional changes in transcription regulation present in ME All subjects were between 30 and 60 years old when samples were collected. Exclusion criteria: all ME/CFS subjects, selected by their medical history and physical examination, had no history of malignancy or other systemic disorders. Additional exclusion criteria included: active smoking or alcohol history, taking medications that could potentially impact immune function (e.g. steroids, immune-suppressors, etc.) Pelleted PBMCs were resuspended in 200 ul of PBS supplemented with proteinase K and RNase A and genomic DNA was obtained from treated lysates. DNA quality and concentration were assessed by Agilent TapeStation 4200 (Agilent Technolo- gies). All DNA samples had DNA Integrity Number (DIN) above 8 (data not shown). 2.2. Genomic DNA methylation profiling For global epigenetic measurements MethylFlash Methyl Methylation of DNA was quantified with bisulfite treatment of DNA and simultaneous PCR. Promoter regions (1500 bp upstream of the transcription start site (TSS) and 500 bp down- stream of TSS) were considered to be differentially methylated if they met the following crite- ria: FDR < 0.1 and absolute beta-value difference between the mean beta-values of cases and controls was greater than 0.05. Genomic DNA from 13 ME/CFS cases and 12 controls (“experimental cohort”) was hybridized to the Illumina MethylationEPIC Miami/Fort Lauderdale Ilumina Infinium ME/ CFS patients (n=13) and healthy controls (n =12) BeadChip arrays. Following data analysis, the obtained results were validated by pyrosequencing on the samples from the experi- mental cohort, as well as on additional Vitality, social functioning, role emotional and mental health were sig- nificantly lower in ME/CFS cases compared to controls. We did not find statistically significant differences in global DNA methylation levels using ELISA-based assay methods. We used an upgraded version of the microarrays for human genome-wide methylation studies. Methylation DNA patterns of PBMCs in ME/CFS individ- uals differ from those of controls. Out of the 17,296 DMS, a total of 14,261 DMS were found within or proximal to genes. About 98% of the DMS within the genic regions were hypomethylated and 2% were hypermethylated overall. We found 307 DMPs in PBMCs of ME/CES cases. 306 of these D MPs are hypomethylated while only one appeared hyper- methylated. Figure 5 shows the distribution of these promoters according to their gene biotype. Almost half of the identified DMP's belong to protein-coding genes. ME/CFS cases showed decreased DNA methylation level in promoters of genes responsible for T cell generation and activity, such as ZCCHC11, CAPNS, IL21R, P2RX5, TREML2, AKNA and CD248. A distinct PLOS ONE pattern of hypomethylated promoters of. genes involved in miRNA expression and bio-metal regulation including metal transporter SLC39A13 (ZIP trans- porter) and DNA methylation plays an important role in the interplay between external (environment) and internal (gene expression) factors. The methylation levels detected by pyrosequencing in ME/CFS individuals were similar to those observed by MethylationEPIC microarrays in all DMS. Only a few studies have reported changes in DNA methylation associated to ME/CFS. Here, we identified differentially methylated CpG sites and promoters in PBMCs of ME/ CFS cases compared to controls in cohorts from two distant geographic locations. We found the MED13L gene which is associated with muscular hypotonia and neurocognitive impairment. We found significant hypo- methylation of the SGK3 (serum glucocorticoid regulated kinase) gene promoter in ME/CFS. We also observed hypomethylation of promoters of MMP14, MAP4K4, MAPK12 and CREBS5. These results indicate that DNA methylation con- con-poses a compensatory homeostatic mechanism. This is the first study that has explored genome-wide epigenetic changes associated with ME/CFS using the new Illumina MethylationEPIC microarrays covering over 850,000 CpG sites. Findings build on previous preliminary reports showing association of altered methylation profiles of genes with immune functions. The economic impact of ME/CFS: individual and societal costs. Pathogenesis of pathogenesis of chronic fatigue syndrome: pathogenesis, pathogenesis and pathophysiology. Epigenetics meets endocrinology. Myalgic Encephalo- myelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Diagnosis and Management in Young People. DNA methylation in ME/CFS induces changes in the expression and methylation of perforin in chronic fatigue syndrome. Methylation is a type of epigenetic change that is thought to be linked to the development of the disease. DNA methylation has been linked to a number of other conditions, including multiple sclerosis. DNA methylation in early lymphocyte development suggests a role for regulation in early disease development. DNA methylation may also play a role in the development of early-onset forms of multiple sclerosis, multiple myeloma, and myelodysplastic syndromes. Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) is a chronic illness that affects up to 10% of the population. CFS is caused by a combination of factors, including a lack of adequate sleep, stress, and stress-reduction medications. The disease is linked to an increased risk of death. Long COVID defines a series of chronic symptoms that may experience after resolution of acute cases. Early reports with patients with long COVID suggests a constellation of symptoms with similarities to another medical illness. Long COVID and Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS)—A Systemic Review and Comparison of Clinical Presentation and Symptomatology. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly contagious respiratory disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) As of 7 March 2021, there are over 100 million cumulative cases, with over 2.5 million deaths worldwide. There is increasing public and academic interest in the chronic sequelae of the disease. Early studies into long COVID symptomatology suggest many overlaps with clinical presentation of ME/C The misconception regarding chronic fatigue syndrome may have been started because of how it was initially characterized. Early reports of chronic fatigue were described as a derogatory term known as the Yuppie Flu. One of the most recent definitions of the illness was formed by the Institute of Medicine in 2015 to avoid further stigma. One of the most prominent potential causes of chronic fatigue syndrome includes infection with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) There exists a large volume of research on the pathogenesis and management of ME/CFS. If long COVID is demonstrated to be a similar chronic medical illness with overlaps in clinical features and symptomatology, it may be conjectured that the existing knowledge on ME/ CFS may benefit patients of long CO VID. We searched for studies into clinical profiles and symptoms of long COVID, published up to 31 January 2021. The titles and abstracts of the identified articles were reviewed, and the full texts of the selected studies were further examined. The search and review process are illustrated in Figure 1, following the PRISMA guideline. Study data were compared to known ME/CFS case definitions. The included long COVID studies are shown in Table 1. The studies are ranked in the chart in descending order according to the number of patients included. When applicable, the percentage of study patients experiencing long CO VID symptoms was provided with the key findings of each study. The long COVID symptoms described by each study were mapped onto a comparison chart between ME/CFS symptoms. All except four ME/minninnitus symptoms were found to be unmatched in Table 2. The results were published in the Journal of the American College of Nutrition. All three major criteria symptoms as specified by most ME/CFS case defini- tions (fatigue, reduced daily activity, post-exertional malaise) were reported by multiple selected long COVID studies. fatigue was the most reported symptom (13 out of 21 eligible studies) Only three se- lected studies met the >6 months duration criteria. There were a few reported long CO VID symptoms that were unique from ME/ CFS symptoms, including olf This is the first review article to examine and compare the symptoms of ME/CFS and long COVID. There is a huge disparity in terms of the timeline of studies, with the time of assessment rang- ing from a month to 6 months after symptom onset. The studies also vary greatly in assessment methodologies; while some studies utilized patient questionnaires, others utilized in-person evaluations. In this systemic review study, the reported symptoms of long COVID from 21 selected studies were compared to a compilation of ME/CFS symptoms from multiple case defini- tions. The results suggest a high degree of similarities between long COVI and ME/ CFS. Despite the findings from this comparison, it may be too early to establish a direc causal relationship. Long COVID has been similarly linked to inflammatory state and dysregulated immune response. Some studies have attempted to characterize the un- derlying pathophysiology of the long COVID symptoms. The results of this review suggest many potential avenues for further exploration and research. While this review provides a qualitative analysis of the similarities and differences, a quantitative analysis is needed. This review represents the first investigation of its kind into the similarities between symptoms of ME/CFS and long COVID. Further studies into the pathogenesis and symptomatology of long COvid are warranted. Investigations into the various contributing factors to long CO VID symptoms, including severity of acute disease, history of medical care, and patient demographics would be beneficial.

Long COVID refers to the chronic symptoms that survivors may experience after SARS-CoV-2 infection and acute coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) disease. Long COVID represents a global public health, medical, and nursing challenge that affects millions of people. Long-term sequelae seen in SARS and MERS are potential references for long COVID. We suggest ways in which DNAm phenomena and markers induced by this virus-host interaction may help clarify the An estimated 10%-20% of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections lead to long COVID. Long COVID can be considered a disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act. The most common symptoms include fatigue, low-grade fever, breathing difficulty, difficulties in cognition or concentration, dizziness, loss of smell or taste. DNA methylation (DNAm) is one of the most studied epigenetic characteristics. It typically involves the. addition of a methyl group at the 5-carbon position of a cytosine. base followed by a guanine base in DNA molecules. DNAm may help explain the variable symptoms and potentially complex pathophysiological mechanisms that are not yet well understood. CpG sites and islands (with high CpG frequency) are implicated in a wide array of genetically influenced phenomena. including aging and cancer, gene methylation, and gene silencing. Lower methylation level of the CPG islands in the DNA promoter sequence increases the expression level of ACE2 and interferon genes. A dose-response relationship may exist between the severity of symptoms and the magnitude of dysregulation in the epigenetic profile in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Only a few published studies are focused on DNAm in long COVID patients through mid-2023, possibly because of the limited time of follow-up. DNAm profiles are known to be a key to formation of long- lasting memory in memory T and B cells. Differences in the DNAm profiles between acute COVID-19 and long COVID may be foun in these immune cells. Drugs that target epigenetic pathways may help maintain immune homeostasis or even boost functional vaccine responses. Among SARS survivors, shortness of breath, fatigue, residual radiological lung lesions, impaired perfusion to the lungs, myalgias, and mental health problems have been observed. We have found no observational studies of human survivors from SARS or MERS that focus on the epigenetic markers of chronic symptoms. Epigenetics, particularly DNA methylation, may play a central role in determining determining pathogenic features. DNAm profiles may be able to predict the type of long COVID symptoms with clinically significant prognostic value. In acute infection, the host anti-viral response may be suppressed, leading to accelerated epigenetic aging and a perturbed methylome. Preliminary results have shown that a portion of the DNAm markers featured in this disturbance can be restored, while others persist for months. CDC: Long COVID or Post-COVID Conditions.
